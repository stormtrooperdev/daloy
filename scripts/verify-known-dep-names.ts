/**
 * Slopsquatting / AI-package-hallucination dependency-name allowlist.
 *
 * Closes the residual gap documented in `SECURITY.md` §
 * "Slopsquatting / AI package hallucination (Aikido 2025 pattern)": the
 * window in which an AI coding assistant confidently emits
 * `pnpm add <hallucinated-name>` and an attacker has pre-registered
 * the hallucinated name on npm.
 *
 * The 24h `minimum-release-age=1440` cooldown in `.npmrc` already
 * defends the *time* axis (Aikido / Lasso research shows
 * hallucination-squat packages are typically detected and unpublished
 * inside that window). This gate defends the *name* axis: every
 * top-level dependency name across the workspace
 * (`dependencies` / `devDependencies` / `peerDependencies` /
 * `optionalDependencies`) must appear in {@link ALLOWED_DEP_NAMES}
 * below. Adding a new dep requires a one-line edit to this file in
 * the same PR — the resulting diff is the explicit "did you mean
 * exactly this package name?" review checkpoint that defeats
 * `pnpm add request-promise-native2` even when the cooldown has
 * elapsed and even when the AI agent is otherwise trusted.
 *
 * The list is exact-match and **deliberately small**. Subdependencies
 * resolved into `pnpm-lock.yaml` are NOT checked here — that is the
 * job of `verify:lockfile` (refuses non-registry sources) and
 * `verify:dep-licenses` (refuses non-permissive transitive licenses).
 * The Aikido write-up specifically calls out *direct* installs as
 * the slopsquatting attack vector — an LLM hallucinates a top-level
 * name, the developer / agent runs `pnpm add` against it, and the
 * malicious package becomes a direct dep. Pinning the top-level
 * surface is therefore the proportionate control.
 *
 * Exit code:
 *   0 — every dep name in every scanned `package.json` is on the
 *       allowlist.
 *   1 — at least one dep name is not on the allowlist; the offending
 *       names + the package.json paths that declared them are printed
 *       to stderr along with a slopsquatting-aware remediation hint.
 *

 * dependency listing on npmjs.com to advertise a ghost name that
