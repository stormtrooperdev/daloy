/**
 * Hijacked-CDN host CI gate (Aikido / Sansec polyfill.io class).
 *
 * Aikido's 2024-06-27 write-up
 * (https://www.aikido.dev/blog/polyfill-io-supply-chain-attack-what-do-you-need-to-do)
 * and Sansec's parallel investigation
 * (https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack)
 * document the **polyfill.io** supply-chain attack: in February 2024 the
 * Chinese CDN operator **Funnull** acquired the `polyfill.io` domain and
 * the matching GitHub repository, then began serving conditional malware
 * from `cdn.polyfill.io` to roughly **110 000 sites** that had embedded
 * the classic `<script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js">`
 * tag. The injected payload only fired against mobile traffic, only on
 * the first request from a given device, and only when the referring
 * page was not an admin / analytics console — so it evaded developer
 * QA while redirecting real users to fake sports-betting and adult
 * sites. Cloudflare, Fastly, and Google all reacted by either taking
 * down ad placements referencing the domain or by setting up safe
 * mirrors. The original `polyfill.io` domain remains under Funnull's
 * control and MUST be treated as compromised.
 *
 * Sansec's follow-up reporting and Silent Push's domain-clustering
 * analysis tied Funnull to a constellation of additional hijacked /
 * Funnull-operated CDN hosts that have also served live malware in the
 * same campaign and its follow-ons:
 *
 *   - `bootcss.com`, `bootcdn.net` — historically used as `<script>`
 *     sources by Chinese front-end tutorials; both have been observed
 *     under the same operator and have served browser-targeted
 *     payloads.
 *   - `staticfile.org`, `staticfile.net` — same operator pattern.
 *   - `polyfill.com`, `polyfillcache.com`, `polyfill-cdn.com` — squats
 *     and aliases registered around the original takedown event.
 *   - `unionadjs.com`, `xhsbpza.com` — Funnull-cluster C2 / ad-fraud
 *     hosts named in Sansec's IOC list.
 *
 * Any `<script>` / `<link>` / `<img>` / `fetch()` / `import()` reference
 * to one of those hosts inside this repository — runtime source,
 * scaffolded templates, documentation site, blog posts, examples — is
 * a **hard IOC** of the polyfill class. The user-facing damage is the
 * same as a malicious npm republish (a hijacked CDN reaches every
 * visitor that loads the page), but the supply-chain primitives this
 * repository's existing `verify:no-remote-exec` /
 * `verify:no-registry-exfiltration` gates protect against do NOT see
 * an HTML `<script src="https://...">` literal in a Markdown blog post
 * or in a scaffolded HTML template. This gate closes that gap.
 *
 * Scope (broader than `src/**` on purpose):
 *
 *   - `src/**`           — framework runtime source.
 *   - `examples/**`      — example apps users copy from.
 *   - `bench/**`         — benchmark fixtures.
 *   - `bin/**`           — published CLI entry points.
 *   - `packages/**`      — `create-daloy` and its templates (the
 *                          scaffolded HTML / package.json snippets
 *                          users get on `pnpm create daloy`).
 *   - `website/**`       — the marketing/docs site (`app/**`,
 *                          `components/**`, blog posts in MDX/TSX).
 *   - `my-app/**`        — local scaffold output checked in for
 *                          contributor smoke tests.
 *   - Top-level docs     — `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.
 *
 * Skipped by design:
 *
 *   - `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `dist-coverage/`, `coverage/`,
 *     `temp_tarball/`, `generated/`, `.next/`, `out/`, `build/`,
 *     `.turbo/`, `.cache/`, `.vercel/`, `.pnpm-store/` — generated /
 *     vendored output, not source under our control.
 *   - `tests/**`           — tests for this very gate must be able to
 *                            mention the IOC strings; mirrors the
 *                            convention used by
 *                            `verify-no-registry-exfiltration` and
 *                            `verify-no-remote-exec`.
 *   - `otherdocs/**`       — internal security-research notes that
 *                            cite the campaign by name.
 *   - `SECURITY.md`,
 *     `ROADMAP.md`,
 *     `CODE_REVIEW.md`     — security-disclosure / release-notes
 *                            documentation that names the campaign by
 *                            host.
 *   - `scripts/verify-no-polyfill-cdns.ts` (this file) and its
 *     compiled `.js` twin — must be able to name the IOCs it gates on.
 *   - `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` — lockfile
 *     entries are tracked by `verify:lockfile-sources` and would
 *     mostly be `cdn.example.com` test fixtures here.
 *
 * Exit code:
 *   0 — no hijacked-CDN host references found in the scanned tree.
 *   1 — at least one was found; offending lines printed to stderr with
 *       the IOC host name and the campaign citation.
 *
 * @since 0.36.0
