/**
 * Socket "npm shrinkwrap" governance gate.
 *
 * Socket's 2024-08-09 write-up
 * (https://socket.dev/blog/understanding-the-security-concerns-of-npm-shrinkwrap)
 * documents `npm-shrinkwrap.json` as a high-severity supply-chain
 * risk: unlike `package-lock.json`, an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file
 * **is published with the package** and, when present at the package
 * root, takes precedence over any consumer's `package-lock.json` on
 * `npm install`. That single file lets a published package:
 *
 *   - lock every transitive dependency to a specific (potentially
 *     unsigned, potentially malicious) version that bypasses the
 *     consumer's own resolver constraints,
 *   - point a transitive at a non-`registry.npmjs.org` tarball URL
 *     (and historically, an HTTP URL — npm warned in 2016 that this
 *     enables MITM RCE: see
 *     https://blog.npmjs.org/post/154400916805/avoid-http-urls-in-shrinkwrap-files.html),
 *   - silently freeze a known-vulnerable transitive forever even
 *     after the consumer updates their direct deps,
 *   - hide install-tree changes from most SCA tools, which scan
 *     `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` but not shrinkwrap.
 *
 * `pnpm` itself ignores `npm-shrinkwrap.json` from dependencies (it
 * uses its own `pnpm-lock.yaml`), so DaloyJS's own install path is
 * safe from a transitive dep that ships one. But:
 *
 *   1. A contributor who accidentally runs `npm shrinkwrap` in the
 *      DaloyJS repo and commits the file would silently override the
 *      pnpm posture for **any** consumer who installs `@daloyjs/core`
 *      with plain `npm install` (or whose CI does so). This gate
 *      refuses to ship in that state.
 *   2. The `create-daloy` scaffolder ships templates verbatim to user
 *      projects; if any template ever included an `npm-shrinkwrap.json`,
 *      a scaffolded user project would inherit a shrinkwrap they
 *      never asked for. This gate fails the build before publish if
 *      that ever sneaks into a template directory.
 *   3. Any committed `package.json` that *adds* `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
 *      to its `files` allowlist is rejected, so a publish cannot be
 *      tricked into shipping one even if it appears in a checkout.
 *
 * The framework's own published `files` allowlist (`@daloyjs/core`:
 * `dist`, `bin`, `README.md`; `create-daloy`: `bin`, `templates`,
 * `README.md`, SBOMs) already prevents a stray shrinkwrap from
 * leaking out — this gate makes that property *enforced*, not
 * merely incidental, so a future "convenience" change cannot quietly
 * regress it.
 *
 * Exit code:
 *   0 — no `npm-shrinkwrap.json` anywhere in the working tree and
 *       no `package.json` lists one in its `files` allowlist.
 *   1 — at least one offending file or manifest entry was found;
 *       the offending paths are printed to stderr.
 *
 * @since 0.34.4
