/**
 * Registry-exfiltration / TLS-bypass / credential-injection CI gate
 * (Socket GemStuffer class).
 *
 * Socket's 2026-05-13 write-up
 * (https://socket.dev/blog/gemstuffer) documents the **GemStuffer**
 * campaign, in which a malicious Ruby script — using only the standard
 * library — exfiltrated scraped data by building a `.gem` archive in
 * `/tmp`, fabricating a credential file under a `HOME` override, and
 * publishing the archive directly to `rubygems.org/api/v1/gems` via a
 * hard-coded API key. SSL certificate verification was disabled to
 * suppress cert errors during the scraping phase. Variants that didn't
 * even shell out to `gem push` built the request by hand with
 * `Net::HTTP::Post`, defeating any "no shell-out" gate by staying inside
 * a single Ruby process.
 *
 * The same technique translates verbatim to a malicious Node package
 * that uses only `node:fs`, `node:os`, and the global `fetch`:
 *
 *   1. **TLS verification bypass** to scrape internal or victim-side
 *      endpoints without cert warnings —
 *      `process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"`, or an
 *      `https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })`, or a `fetch` /
 *      `tls.connect` option of `rejectUnauthorized: false`.
 *   2. **`HOME` / npm-credential-file mutation** to inject a publish
 *      token into a fabricated home directory and then run `npm publish`
 *      / `pnpm publish` (already blocked by `verify-no-remote-exec`'s
 *      `child_process` ban) OR to leak a token from the consumer's real
 *      `~/.npmrc` by reading `os.homedir() + "/.npmrc"`.
 *   3. **Direct POST to a package-registry publish endpoint** — the
 *      "skip-the-CLI" GemStuffer variant translated to Node would
 *      construct a `fetch("https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/...",
 *      { method: "POST", body: tarball })` (or the equivalent for
 *      RubyGems, PyPI, crates.io, Hex.pm) inside the runtime source
 *      itself. No `child_process` is needed; the entire exfil pipeline
 *      runs inside one Node process using only stdlib + global `fetch`.
 *
 * Daloy's runtime source (`src/**`) MUST NOT do any of the above. This
 * gate refuses to merge a PR that adds:
 *
 *   - `rejectUnauthorized: false` (any object-literal property
 *     assigning the literal `false` to `rejectUnauthorized`) — used by
 *     `https`, `tls`, `node-fetch`, `undici`, etc.
 *   - `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` as an environment-variable mutation
 *     target (`process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"`).
 *   - `process.env.HOME = ...` mutation (GemStuffer's HOME redirect).
 *   - String literals referencing the publish path of any major package
 *     registry: `registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/...`, `rubygems.org/api/v1`,
 *     `upload.pypi.org`, `crates.io/api/v1/crates/new`, `hex.pm/api/...`.
 *   - Reads of `~/.npmrc`, `~/.yarnrc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.gem/credentials`
 *     (host credential files the malicious package would slurp).
 *
 * This gate is the regression net for the GemStuffer attack class.
 * Combined with `verify-no-remote-exec` (no `child_process` / no `vm` /
 * no `eval` / no `new Function` / no remote dynamic `import`), a
 * malicious republish of `@daloyjs/core` has no in-process exfiltration
 * channel: it cannot shell out to `npm publish`, it cannot fetch an
 * internal endpoint with cert verification disabled, and it cannot POST
 * a tarball to a registry endpoint directly from runtime code.
 *
 * Exit code:
 *   0 — no forbidden primitives found in `src/**`.
 *   1 — at least one was found; offending lines printed to stderr.
 *
 * @since 0.50.0
