/**
 * Country-level access control for {@link Hooks}. The {@link geoBlock}
 * middleware enforces ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country allow- and deny-lists by
 * mapping the client IP to a country **using an operator-supplied lookup** —
 * Daloy bundles no GeoIP database and adds no runtime dependency, keeping the
 * `@daloyjs/core` zero-dependency floor intact.
 *
 * Two resolution strategies are supported, exactly one of which must be wired:
 *
 * - `lookupCountry(ip)` — you own the IP → country mapping (e.g. a MaxMind
 *   GeoLite2 reader, an `ip2location` reader, or your own table). Daloy
 *   resolves the client IP (reusing the same `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`
 *   handling as {@link "./ip-restriction.js".ipRestriction}) and hands you the
 *   string.
 * - `resolveCountry(ctx)` — the country is already attached to the request by
 *   an upstream edge (e.g. Cloudflare's `CF-IPCountry`, AWS CloudFront's
 *   `CloudFront-Viewer-Country`, Vercel's `x-vercel-ip-country`); you read it
 *   straight off the context.
 *
 * Like the other network guards this fails **closed for allow-lists** (an
 * unknown country is rejected when an allow-list is configured) and **open for
 * deny-only** configurations, so a missing lookup cannot silently widen access.
