/**
 * Tests for `scripts/verify-no-leaky-agent-skills.ts` — the Snyk
 * OpenClaw / ClawHub "leaky skills" gate.
 *
 * Pure scanner is exercised with synthetic fixtures so the tests do
 * not depend on the live tree. A final end-to-end assertion runs the
 * gate against the real repo to make sure none of our own shipped
 * SKILL.md / AGENTS.md files trip it.
