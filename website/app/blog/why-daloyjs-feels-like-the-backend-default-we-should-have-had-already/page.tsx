          <p>
            I have shipped enough backends to know that most teams do not lose
            sleep because routing is hard. They lose sleep because security gets
            treated like a side quest. Someone wires up an API, adds a database,
            maybe a queue if they are feeling brave, and ships it with the
            confidence of a person assembling furniture from one blurry photo.
            Sometimes that works. Then Monday happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            DaloyJS feels like the backend default we should have had already
            because it starts with the right assumptions: developers are busy,
            AI agents are now part of the toolchain, and attackers are not
            waiting politely for everybody to finish the tutorial.
          </p>

          <h2>The boring controls are the good controls</h2>

          <p>
            The supply-chain part matters more than people like to admit.
            Attackers are using LLMs to scale package impersonation, dependency
            reconnaissance, and workflow abuse. The answer is not to panic and
            become a security monk. The answer is to ship a sane set of
            defaults.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ini" code={SAFETY_DEFAULTS} />

          <p>
            Those lines are not glamorous. They are also the sort of thing that
            quietly prevents extremely annoying incidents. I trust boring
            controls more than dramatic postmortems.
          </p>

          <h2>Runtime guardrails should be part of the framework story</h2>

          <p>
            I also like that DaloyJS treats security as product behavior instead
            of a lecture. The framework is explicit about CSRF, IP restriction,
            SSRF guardrails, open redirect handling, login throttling, and other
            defensive layers that too many teams only discover after reading a
            report with the phrase &quot;proof of concept&quot; in it.
          </p>

          <p>
            More importantly, it keeps the core development flow readable. One
            route definition becomes validation, types, OpenAPI 3.1, docs, and
            typed clients. That means fewer places for truth to drift and fewer
            moments where the code says one thing while the generated docs say
            something charmingly fictional.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={SAMPLE_APP} />

          <h2>Why this feels underrated</h2>

          <p>
            DaloyJS is solving the unglamorous problems first: install-time
            safety, runtime guardrails, contract-first design, and deploy-time
            discipline. That is not flashy. It is just useful. I would rather
            have a framework that removes common failure modes than one that
            gives me a tenth way to name a router group.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I were starting a new REST API today, I would want the framework
            to assume people are busy and production is real. DaloyJS is one of
            the few that feels built around that premise. Less drama, fewer
            surprises, and ideally fewer meetings about how a suspicious package
            ended up in the lockfile.
          </p>
