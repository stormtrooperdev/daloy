            A friend of mine once shipped a small Express API, went to sleep,
            and woke up to a server that had spent the night losing a fight with
            a gradually inflating request body. No body cap, no meaningful
            timeout, no guardrail, just vibes and rising memory usage. He is a
            competent developer. He was also busy. Those two facts coexist all
            the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            That is why DaloyJS stands out. It is not trying to win by making
            routing 3 percent prettier. It wins by bundling the things teams
            usually forget: typed contracts, OpenAPI, docs, client generation,
            and a security posture that does not depend on whether somebody had
            enough coffee before opening the middleware docs.
          </p>

          <h2>The shape of a safer default</h2>

          <p>
            Here is the part I like: a minimal DaloyJS app already looks like a
            production-minded starting point instead of a tutorial you are meant
            to harden later. Validation lives beside the handler, the route is a
            contract, and the common defenses are present without begging for
            plugins.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={MINIMAL_APP} />

          <p>
            That single file gives you strong request typing, route-level
            validation, rate limiting, secure headers, request IDs, and a live
            OpenAPI document. The nice part is not that these capabilities
            exist. Most ecosystems have them. The nice part is that they stop
            being six separate decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>Security you get before you ask for it</h2>

          <p>
            DaloyJS is opinionated in the correct direction. Body limits,
            prototype-pollution-safe parsing, path traversal rejection, response
            hardening, and request timeout behavior are part of the framework
            story. You can still add the more specialized network controls when
            you need them, but the baseline no longer starts at zero.
          </p>

          <p>
            That matters more in 2026 because the average backend is no longer
            written only by backend specialists. AI coding agents, copy-paste,
            and deadline math have made &quot;I meant to secure it later&quot;
            one of the most common architectural styles on the internet.
          </p>

          <h2>The supply-chain part is unusually sane</h2>

          <p>
            The scaffolded pnpm defaults are some of the most practical parts of
            the whole package. They do not try to turn you into a full-time
            security program. They just remove several easy ways to get hurt.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ini" code={NPMRC} />

          <p>
            The 24-hour release-age delay is especially good. Most npm malware
            campaigns are found fast, because the attackers are greedy and the
            ecosystem is noisy. Waiting one day before you install a fresh
            version is one of those rare controls that is both boring and sharp.
            My favorite category of engineering decision.
          </p>

          <h2>The contract-first workflow is the actual quality-of-life win</h2>

          <p>
            Security gets the headline, but the contract-first model is what
            makes the day-to-day experience good. One route definition feeds the
            handler types, OpenAPI, docs, and client surface. Less drift, fewer
            duplicated truths, and fewer meetings where everybody stares at an
            outdated YAML file like it personally betrayed them.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={TYPED_CLIENT} />

          <p>
            If you have ever maintained a frontend and a backend that disagreed
            about whether a field was optional, you already know why this is a
            better deal.
          </p>

          <h2>It deserves more attention than it gets</h2>

          <p>
            DaloyJS still feels underrated to me because it is solving the least
            glamorous problems first. Install-time safety. Runtime defaults.
            Contract drift. Typed clients. Portable execution. None of that is a
            flashy conference demo, but it is exactly what makes teams faster
            once the demo is over and actual maintenance begins.
          </p>
