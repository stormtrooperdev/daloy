            and asked the only question worth asking when someone hands you a
            security checklist: <em>are we doing any of this?</em> Fair
            question. The piece is a tour of Zero Trust, defense-in-depth, IAM,
            network segmentation, IaC scanning, and continuous monitoring — the
            meat-and-potatoes of modern cloud security architecture.
          </p>

          <p>
            It&apos;s a <em>cloud</em> guide, not a framework guide. A lot of it
            lives at a layer DaloyJS will never touch — VPC peering, S3 bucket
            ACLs, GuardDuty, the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar. But every
            one of its principles has an <strong>application-layer half</strong>
            , and that half is where a framework lives or dies. Below is the
            honest mapping: what Daloy already gives you for free, what it gives
            you when you opt in, and what stays in the cloud account&apos;s
            lane.
          </p>

          <p>
            Spoiler: if your worry was &quot;does my framework actively
            <em> undermine </em> the architecture in that post,&quot; the answer
            is no. The boring defenses are on by default. The shared-
            responsibility line is drawn cleanly.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Principle 1 — Zero Trust: &quot;never trust, always verify&quot;
          </h2>

          <PrincipleCard
            principle="Verify explicitly · least privilege · assume breach"
            framework="JWT + JWKS middleware with audience/issuer pinning, basic auth wired to timingSafeEqual, per-route auth scopes, IP allow-lists for admin surfaces, signed-cookie sessions with rotating signing keys, production-mode stack-trace redaction in error responses."
            platform="Issuing the JWTs (Okta / Entra / Auth0), enforcing MFA at the IdP, rotating IAM roles, and segmenting accounts/projects."
          />

          <p>
            Zero Trust at the application layer is not a vibe — it&apos;s a
            chain of <em>explicit verification points</em> that don&apos;t
            collapse into &quot;the firewall said it was fine.&quot; Daloy gives
            you the verifying middleware as first-class primitives, so the chain
            is visible in your <code>app.ts</code>:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={ZERO_TRUST} />

          <p>
            Two non-negotiables worth pointing out: every secret comparison in
            the framework — basic auth, CSRF tokens, session HMAC, webhook
            signatures — runs through <code>timingSafeEqual</code>. There is a
            CI guard (<code>verify:secret-comparisons</code>) that fails the
            build if anyone tries to slip a raw <code>===</code> back in. And
            the JWT middleware refuses unsigned tokens, refuses{" "}
            <code>alg: none</code>, and pins to JWKS by <code>kid</code> — so a
            stolen audience claim doesn&apos;t silently become a master key.
          </p>

          <h2>Principle 2 — Defense-in-depth</h2>

          <PrincipleCard
            principle="Multiple independent layers, any one of which can stop an attack"
            framework="Bounded body reads, request timeouts, CSP nonces, Trusted Types, HSTS, CORS, multi-instance rate limiting (Redis Lua), load shedding, egress fetch guard (SSRF), BREACH-aware compression, prototype-pollution-safe JSON, CRLF & path-traversal rejection."
            platform="Network ACLs, WAF, VPC segmentation, security groups, KMS encryption-at-rest, TLS termination."
          />

          <p>
            The post&apos;s castle analogy — moat, wall, towers, keep — maps
            almost one-for-one to a Daloy middleware pipeline. The point
            isn&apos;t that one layer catches everything; it&apos;s that
            removing one doesn&apos;t silently disable the others:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={DEFENSE_IN_DEPTH} />

          <p>
            For the deep tour of which of these run with <code>new App()</code>{" "}
            and which require a flag, see the older{" "}
            <Link href="/blog/secure-by-default">
              &quot;Secure by Default&quot;
            </Link>{" "}
            post.
          </p>

          <h2>Principle 3 — Centralize IAM</h2>

          <PrincipleCard
            principle="Federated identity, MFA everywhere, roles not long-lived keys"
            framework="JWKS-based verification (rotation built in), session signing key arrays (rotate without logging users out), no shared-secret defaults baked into the framework, no long-lived API tokens generated for you."
            platform="Pick the IdP. Wire MFA. Use cloud-native role assumption (IRSA, Workload Identity, Managed Identities) so your pods don't hold static keys."
          />

          <p>
            The framework explicitly{" "}
            <strong>does not invent a user system</strong> for you. There is no
            built-in &quot;forgot password&quot; route silently shipped with
            every project, no default admin account, no auto-issued bearer
            token. The thing IAM guides hate most — &quot;the framework&apos;s
            default user table&quot; — does not exist here. You bring an IdP and
            Daloy verifies what it signs.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the secrets that <em>do</em> live in the app (session signing
            key, basic-auth password, webhook HMAC), the framework supports
            multi-value rotation: pass an array of secrets and the oldest one is
            accepted-but-not-issued, so a key rotation is a single deploy with
            no logout storm.
          </p>

          <h2>Principle 4 — Segmented network &amp; SSRF protection</h2>

          <PrincipleCard
            principle="Limit blast radius; secure ingress AND egress"
            framework="fetchGuard() egress allow-list with default-deny on cloud metadata IPs (169.254.169.254) and RFC1918 ranges; CORS allow-lists; ipRestriction() for admin surfaces; per-route mount paths so 'public' and 'internal' apps can be split."
            platform="VPC subnets, security groups, NAT gateways, service mesh mTLS, private endpoints."
          />

          <p>
            The article spends a lot of words on micro-segmentation. The
            application-layer analogue — and the one the cloud guide{" "}
            <em>doesn&apos;t</em> cover — is server-side request forgery. A
            compromised handler that can <code>fetch()</code> anywhere can still
            reach AWS metadata, your private Redis, your internal admin
            dashboard, and any IMDSv1 endpoint that didn&apos;t get upgraded.{" "}
            <code>fetchGuard()</code> is the application-layer firewall:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={FETCH_GUARD} />

          <p>
            See{" "}
            <Link href="/docs/security/fetch-guard">the fetch-guard docs</Link>{" "}
            for the full default deny-list and how it composes with timeouts.
          </p>

          <h2>Principle 5 — Automate security with IaC scanning</h2>

          <PrincipleCard
            principle="Scan infrastructure-as-code in CI before it ships"
            framework="The framework's own repo runs ~15 verify-* gates on every PR. The scaffolded app from create-daloy ships with the same CI workflow templates so your project gets them on day one."
            platform="Terraform / CloudFormation / Pulumi scanners (Checkov, tfsec, Aikido, etc.) for your cloud resources. Daloy does not scan your S3 buckets — but it does refuse to install a dependency that runs a postinstall script."
          />

          <p>
            The cloud post is talking about Terraform scanners. The framework
            analogue is the supply-chain CI gate. These are not aspirational —
            they all run today, and a failure blocks merge:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="bash" code={SUPPLY_CHAIN_VERIFY} />

          <p>
            The reasoning behind each one is in{" "}
            <Link href="/blog/supply-chain-hardening-for-typescript-libraries">
              &quot;Supply-chain hardening for TypeScript libraries&quot;
            </Link>
            . Short version: pnpm&apos;s install-time defaults, plus our CI
            gates, plus a release-age cooldown, plus SHA-pinned Actions, plus
            npm provenance, plus a CycloneDX SBOM — chosen because attackers
            don&apos;t need a 0-day if they can ship a malicious{" "}
            <code>postinstall</code>.
          </p>

          <h2>Principle 6 — Continuous monitoring (CSPM-equivalent)</h2>

          <PrincipleCard
            principle="A single pane of glass for security posture"
            framework="Structured per-request JSON logs with correlated request IDs, automatic redaction of Authorization / Cookie / Set-Cookie / X-API-Key, Server-Timing, and OpenTelemetry-shaped spans — same shape on Node, Bun, Workers, and Vercel Edge."
            platform="Ship the logs into your SIEM (CloudWatch / Datadog / Splunk / Loki). Daloy doesn't run the dashboard; it makes sure the events are useful when they arrive."
          />

          <p>
            CSPM tools want one thing from the application: clean,
            machine-readable, redacted events. That&apos;s what the logger
            ships:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={STRUCTURED_LOGS} />

          <p>
            The redaction is not a string regex pass — it walks the object
            graph, so a secret hiding inside <code>req.body.user.token</code>{" "}
            gets redacted the same way an Authorization header does. The list of
            keys is extensible; the defaults are conservative. If your company
            adds a new secret-shaped header, you add one string.
          </p>

          <h2>The &quot;assume breach&quot; defaults you already have</h2>

          <p>
            The article&apos;s most underrated line is &quot;assume a breach
            will happen. Focus on minimizing the impact.&quot; Translated into
            framework behavior, that means the defaults must minimize blast
            radius even when a handler is buggy or compromised. Daloy&apos;s
            assume-breach defaults are the seven below, and they are not opt-in:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={ASSUME_BREACH} />

          <h2>What we do not do (the honest part)</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We don&apos;t scan your cloud configuration. If you mis-IAM an S3
              bucket, Daloy won&apos;t know. Use the cloud provider&apos;s
              tooling or a CSPM vendor — the Aikido post lists several.
            </li>
            <li>
              We don&apos;t encrypt your database. That&apos;s the data
              layer&apos;s job (RDS encryption, KMS-managed keys). The framework
              defaults to TLS for outbound connections and a fetch-guard
              allow-list, but it cannot prove your DB is encrypted at rest.
            </li>
            <li>
              We don&apos;t do runtime threat detection (GuardDuty / Falco). We
              give you the structured event stream a detector needs; someone
              still has to run the detector.
            </li>
            <li>
              We don&apos;t replace your WAF. <code>secureHeaders()</code>,{" "}
              <code>rateLimit()</code>, and <code>loadShedding()</code> are
              application-layer L7 — they overlap with a CDN/WAF and work behind
              one, but they are not the same thing.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            That&apos;s the line. If a checklist says &quot;the application
            framework must do X,&quot; Daloy does X by default or via a
            documented opt-in. If a checklist says &quot;the cloud account must
            do X,&quot; we don&apos;t lie about owning it.
          </p>

          <h2>A 60-second checklist for your own deploy</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <code>new App()</code> with no overrides — you already have body
              limits, request timeouts, problem+json redaction in production,
              and prototype-pollution-safe JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add <code>secureHeaders()</code>, <code>rateLimit()</code>,{" "}
              <code>loadShedding()</code>, and <code>fetchGuard()</code> — four
              lines, four layers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wire <code>jwt()</code> to your IdP&apos;s JWKS. Don&apos;t pass a
              static secret. Pin <code>audience</code> and <code>issuer</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mount admin under <code>/admin</code> with{" "}
              <code>ipRestriction()</code> + <code>basicAuth()</code> (or move
              it off the public app entirely).
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn on the structured logger and point your SIEM at stdout.
            </li>
            <li>
              Run <code>pnpm verify:*</code> in CI and gate merges on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read <Link href="/docs/security">/docs/security</Link> once.
              Bookmark{" "}
              <Link href="/docs/security/owasp-api-top-10">
                /docs/security/owasp-api-top-10
              </Link>
              .
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            None of this is novel — that&apos;s the point. The whole reason the
            Aikido post exists is that the boring defenses are still the ones
            that prevent breaches. Daloy&apos;s job is to make sure you
            can&apos;t accidentally skip them.
