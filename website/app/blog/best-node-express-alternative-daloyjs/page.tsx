            Every &quot;best Express alternative&quot; listicle gives you the
            same shortlist: Fastify for maturity, Hono for the edge, Elysia for
            Bun. They are all defensible picks, and I have shipped production
            code on all three. But the listicles almost always evaluate the
            wrong axis. They benchmark requests per second and count GitHub
            stars, when the thing that actually decides whether an Express
            alternative was a good choice is something far less photogenic: how
            much of your API&apos;s <em>truth</em> the framework derives for
            you, and how much of your security perimeter it owns by default.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have spent about ten years building and inheriting Node services,
            currently from Norway, and I want to make a specific, falsifiable
            argument: in 2026, the best Node.js Express alternative for a new
            service is a contract-first one, and the strongest contract-first
            option in the TypeScript ecosystem right now is DaloyJS. This is the
            case for that claim, including the parts where it does not hold.
          </p>

          <h2>The axis everyone benchmarks is the one that matters least</h2>
          <p>
            Express is not slow, and neither are its alternatives. For the
            overwhelming majority of services, your bottleneck is a database
            round trip, a downstream API, or your own N+1 query, not the router.
            So when a framework&apos;s pitch leads with throughput, it is
            answering a question almost nobody&apos;s production incident was
            actually about.
          </p>
          <p>
            The questions your incidents <em>are</em> about: why did the docs
            say <code>title</code> when the API returns <code>name</code>? Why
            did a 2GB request body take down a pod? Why did{" "}
            <code>__proto__</code> in a JSON payload poison an object three
            layers deep? Why did a user-supplied URL in a webhook config reach
            the cloud metadata endpoint? None of those are throughput problems.
            All of them are <em>contract</em> and <em>default-posture</em>{" "}
            problems. That is the axis a serious Express alternative has to win
            on.
          </p>

          <h2>Why &quot;contract-first&quot; is the real category</h2>
          <p>
            Express&apos;s design center is one sentence from its own docs: an
            Express app is &quot;essentially a series of middleware function
            calls.&quot; That model is structurally ignorant of your API. The
            pipeline does not know what a route accepts or returns.{" "}
            <code>req.body</code> is <code>any</code>. There is no contract
            anywhere in the architecture, so there is nothing to validate
            against, generate docs from, derive types from, or build a client
            out of. Every one of those becomes a hand-maintained artifact, and
            hand-maintained artifacts drift. Not because your team is
            undisciplined, but because the architecture gave the contract no
            canonical home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contract-first inverts that. DaloyJS makes one route definition the
            source of truth and derives everything downstream from it:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={ROUTE_EXAMPLE} />

          <p>
            That one object is the validation rule, the type source, the OpenAPI
            3.1 operation, and the input to the generated typed client (
            <code>pnpm gen</code>, wrapping Hey API). The dependency arrow is
            reversed: the docs depend on the route, mechanically, with no human
            in the loop to forget. Rename a field and the spec, the client
            types, and the frontend call site all move or refuse to compile.
            This is the FastAPI insight, finally brought to TypeScript without
            the decorator-metaprogramming circus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fastify approximates this with JSON Schema and type providers.
            Elysia approximates it with end-to-end typed handlers. Both are
            good. DaloyJS goes further by treating the OpenAPI document and the
            generated SDK as first-class, derived outputs rather than community
            plugins you assemble.
          </p>

          <h2>The part that should decide it: defaults</h2>
          <p>
            Write the real security checklist for an internet-facing HTTP API.
            The honest version: body-size caps, request and handler timeouts,
            prototype-pollution-safe parsing, CRLF and header-injection
            rejection, path-traversal defense, real 405s, 5xx redaction in
            production, JWT algorithm allowlists, constant-time credential
            comparison, SSRF guards on outbound fetches, secure headers, sane
            CORS, CSRF, rate limiting, and the supply chain that installs all of
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now be honest about how much of that each Express alternative gives
            you <em>before you configure anything</em>. Express: almost none.
            Fastify: some, the rest via plugins you must know to add. Hono and
            Elysia: most of it opt-in. DaloyJS makes it the default, and the
            project&apos;s contributor rules explicitly treat{" "}
            <em>weakening a guard to make a test pass</em> as a bug.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why this matters in 2026 specifically: a large and growing share of
            backend code is written by AI assistants, and an AI agent implements
            exactly the security you can name and not one guard you cannot. The
            Supabase and Aikido write-up on secure-by-default development
            compressed it into a sentence I keep quoting: &quot;If you tell an
            AI to make something work, it might remove the very security checks
            that protect you.&quot; Starting from a framework where the
            checklist is the default flips the burden: you have to consciously
            remove protection rather than consciously remember to add it. That
            is the property I want from an Express alternative in the
            agentic-coding era, and it is the one the throughput benchmarks
            never measure.
          </p>

          <h2>The supply-chain footnote that is not a footnote</h2>
          <p>
            <code>@daloyjs/core</code> has zero runtime dependencies. After
            living through a dependency-confusion scare and a postinstall-script
            incident, I read that number as a security property, not a vanity
            metric. Fewer transitive packages is a smaller attack surface and a
            more auditable install. Express pulls a tree. Most alternatives pull
            a smaller but non-trivial one. Zero is a different category.
          </p>

          <h2>Where the argument breaks (because it does)</h2>
          <p>I would not trust this post if it did not have this section.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ecosystem.</strong> Express has fifteen years of
              middleware for everything. If you need a niche integration that
              exists only as Express middleware, you are porting it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Familiarity and hiring.</strong> Every Node engineer knows
              Express. DaloyJS is new, so there is a small onboarding curve
              around the route-as-object and return-don&apos;t-mutate model.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maturity.</strong> Fastify has years of battle-testing and
              a huge production footprint. &quot;New and principled&quot; is not
              the same as &quot;proven at your scale.&quot;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Raw minimalism.</strong> If you want a bare router with
              nothing opinionated, Hono is lighter. DaloyJS is opinionated on
              purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The claim, restated</h2>
          <p>
            The best Node.js Express alternative in 2026 is not the fastest
            router or the one with the most stars. It is the one that makes your
            API contract a derived artifact instead of a maintained one, and
            makes the security checklist a default you must consciously weaken
            instead of homework you must consciously remember. On those two
            axes, contract-first wins the category, and DaloyJS is the strongest
            contract-first option in TypeScript today, with the caveat that
            Fastify is the safer pick if maturity outranks everything else for
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped starting new services on Express not because it is bad,
            but because I got tired of being the human whose job was to remember
            the things the framework decided were my problem. After ten years, I
            would rather the framework remembered them, and made me file a PR to
            forget.
          </p>
