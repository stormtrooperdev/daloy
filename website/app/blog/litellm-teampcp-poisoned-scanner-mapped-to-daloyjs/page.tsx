              Snyk&apos;s write-up of the LiteLLM / TeamPCP compromise
            </a>
            . The question was the same:{" "}
            <em>are we doing anything about this?</em> Yes. Most of it was
            already shipped. The post is the receipt.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the unfamiliar, the short version: on March 24, 2026, a threat
            actor known as <strong>TeamPCP</strong> published two backdoored
            versions of the <code>litellm</code> Python package (1.82.7 and
            1.82.8) to PyPI. They didn&apos;t hack PyPI. They didn&apos;t guess
            the maintainer&apos;s password. They stole the{" "}
            <code>PYPI_PUBLISH</code> token straight out of LiteLLM&apos;s
            GitHub Actions runner environment via a previously compromised{" "}
            <strong>Trivy GitHub Action</strong>: a <em>security scanner</em>{" "}
            that LiteLLM&apos;s CI ran during the build. Same trick was used to
            backdoor Checkmarx KICS a day earlier.
          </p>

          <p>
            The payload was a Python <code>.pth</code> file that fires every
            time the interpreter starts, including during{" "}
            <code>pip install</code> itself, harvested SSH keys, cloud
            credentials, kubeconfigs, and crypto wallets, encrypted them with a
            hardcoded RSA key, and POSTed the bundle to{" "}
            <code>models.litellm.cloud</code> (registered the day before). Then
            it installed a systemd persistence service called &quot;System
            Telemetry Service&quot; and, if it found a Kubernetes
            service-account token, deployed privileged pods named{" "}
            <code>node-setup-*</code> to every node in <code>kube-system</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            DaloyJS is Node/TypeScript, not Python, so the <code>.pth</code>{" "}
            hook is not literally applicable. But the <em>attack chain</em>: 
            poisoned scanner action → exfiltrated publish token → malicious
            release that runs at install time, is platform-agnostic, and is
            exactly what every JS framework that publishes to npm has to defend
            against. Here is how each stage maps to what&apos;s already in this
            repo, in the order the attack ran.
          </p>

          <h2>Stage 0: The Trivy tag rewrite (March 19)</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Initial compromise"
            litellm="Attackers rewrote the v0.69.4 git tag on the aquasecurity/trivy-action repository to point at a malicious commit. Anyone using 'uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.69.4' pulled the malicious version on their next CI run."
            daloyjs="Every GitHub Action in this repo is pinned to a 40-character commit SHA, not a tag. A tag rewrite is a no-op. 'verify:actions-pinned' is a release-blocking gate and runs on every PR, landing 'uses: foo/bar@v2' without a resolved SHA fails CI before merge."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="yaml" code={SHA_PINNED} />

          <p>
            This is the single most important defense for this entire attack
            class, and it costs nothing. The Snyk post calls out{" "}
            <em>
              &quot;LiteLLM&apos;s CI/CD pipeline ran Trivy as part of its build
              process, pulling it from apt without a pinned version&quot;
            </em>
            . That sentence describes a class of mistake DaloyJS&apos;s CI{" "}
            <em>cannot</em> make, there are zero <code>apt install</code> calls
            in any workflow, and the only binaries downloaded at runtime
            (opengrep) are cosign-verified against the publisher&apos;s OIDC
            identity before they are executed.
          </p>

          <h2>Stage 1: Token exfiltration from the runner</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Credential theft"
            litellm="The compromised Trivy action ran in the same job as the publish step, so it could read PYPI_PUBLISH from the process environment, base64-encode it, and POST it to the attacker's C2 domain."
            daloyjs="Three separate defenses. (1) Scanners and publish are in different workflows; the publish workflow has zero scanner steps. (2) The publish job runs in a GitHub Environment ('npm-publish') gated on manual maintainer approval. (3) Publishing uses npm Trusted Publishing via OIDC, there is no long-lived NPM_TOKEN sitting in repo secrets to steal."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="bash" code={SCANNER_ISOLATION} />

          <CodeBlock language="yaml" code={TRUSTED_PUBLISHING} />

          <p>
            The Snyk post quietly buries the most useful sentence in the whole
            article:{" "}
            <em>
              &quot;The package passes all standard integrity checks because the
              malicious content was published using legitimate
              credentials.&quot;
            </em>{" "}
            That&apos;s the whole game. If the attacker can&apos;t get the
            credentials, every hash check in the world still passes, because
            the bad version never ships. Removing the long-lived publish token
            removes the prize.
          </p>

          <h2>Stage 2: The install-time payload</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Execution on install"
            litellm="litellm 1.82.8 added litellm_init.pth to site-packages/. Python's startup-hook mechanism fires on every interpreter launch, including 'pip install', 'python -c', and IDE language servers, with no import required. pip's hash check passed because the .pth file was correctly listed in the wheel's RECORD."
            daloyjs="npm's equivalent execution vector is lifecycle scripts (preinstall / install / postinstall / prepare). The root .npmrc sets ignore-scripts=true, every CI install runs with --ignore-scripts, and 'verify:no-lifecycle-scripts' rejects PRs that try to add one. The create-daloy templates ship the same .npmrc. There is no in-repo equivalent of the .pth trick, and 'verify:no-encoded-payloads' would also flag a base64-embedded blob the way TeamPCP smuggled theirs."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="ini" code={NPMRC} />

          <p>
            The other half of this defense is the 24-hour{" "}
            <code>minimum-release-age</code> cooldown. The malicious LiteLLM
            versions were on PyPI for <strong>about three hours</strong> before
            PyPI quarantined them. A pnpm install against a registry that honors
            release-age would have refused to fetch them at all. Most worm
            campaigns we&apos;ve seen, chalk, debug, the Shai-Hulud sweeps, 
            are caught and unpublished inside the same window.
          </p>

          <h2>Stage 3: Persistence and lateral movement</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Persistence + Kubernetes worm"
            litellm="Wrote ~/.config/sysmon/sysmon.py, registered a 'sysmon.service' systemd user unit polling https://checkmarx.zone/raw every 5 minutes. If a Kubernetes service-account token was present, deployed privileged 'node-setup-*' pods to every node in kube-system."
            daloyjs="Once the payload can't run at install time, none of this happens on a build runner, the systemd / pod-deployment behavior never gets a chance. For the runtime side, harden-runner runs in egress-audit mode on every job, so the first 'curl POST to models.litellm.cloud' lands in the workflow log. The publish job specifically sets disable-sudo: true so a runtime payload can't elevate even if one did slip through."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="yaml" code={HARDEN_RUNNER} />

          <h2>Stage 4: The framework&apos;s own dependency surface</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Blast radius"
            litellm="litellm is downloaded ~3.4 million times a day and is a transitive dependency of DSPy, MLflow, OpenHands, CrewAI, Phoenix, langwatch, and others, every consumer inherited the .pth."
            daloyjs="@daloyjs/core has zero runtime dependencies. 'verify:no-runtime-deps' fails the build if anyone adds one. The transitive blast radius is, by construction, the size of the framework itself."
          />

          <p>
            This is the single most boring decision in DaloyJS, and it&apos;s
            the one I&apos;m proudest of. Frameworks that pull in 30 transitive
            packages at runtime cannot honestly claim a hardened supply chain, 
            the attacker only has to compromise the smallest of those 30. A
            zero-runtime-deps core has exactly one supply-chain target: the core
            itself, published through the gated OIDC pipeline above.
          </p>

          <h2>The full CI gate list, for the receipts</h2>

          <CodeBlock language="bash" code={VERIFY_GATES} />

          <p>
            Every one of those runs in <code>release.yml</code> before{" "}
            <code>npm stage publish</code> ever fires, and most of them run on
            every PR too. None of them are aspirational, a failure blocks
            merge. The full reasoning for each is in{" "}

            <li>
              Trigger a publish without a maintainer approving it in the{" "}
              <code>npm-publish</code> Environment, impossible by design.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beat the 24-hour <code>minimum-release-age</code> cooldown into
              every downstream pnpm install, also impossible by design.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Could a determined attacker still find a way? Of course, security
            is never &quot;done.&quot; But the path of least resistance the
            LiteLLM compromise took (rewrite an action tag, steal a static
            token, ship a release that auto-runs on install) is shut on all four
            steps in this repo. That&apos;s the point of secure-by-default: the
            obvious attack doesn&apos;t work, and the non-obvious ones cost real
            effort.

          <h2>What you should do in your own DaloyJS project</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Scaffold with <code>pnpm create daloy@latest --with-ci</code>. The
              generated <code>.github/workflows/</code> and <code>.npmrc</code>{" "}
              already carry the SHA-pinned actions, <code>ignore-scripts</code>,
              and 24h release-age cooldown.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you publish your own packages, use npm Trusted Publishing
              (OIDC). Delete any long-lived <code>NPM_TOKEN</code> from repo
              secrets. The blog post linked above has the exact{" "}
              <code>permissions:</code> block.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don&apos;t run third-party security scanners in the same job as
              your publish step. Different workflow, different permissions,
              different runner identity. The LiteLLM team didn&apos;t, 
              that&apos;s how they ended up here.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn on <code>step-security/harden-runner</code> with{" "}
              <code>egress-policy: audit</code> (or{" "}
              <code>egress-policy: block</code> if you know your allow-list).
              That alone would have surfaced the{" "}
              <code>models.litellm.cloud</code> POST in real time.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The honest answer to the original question</h2>

          <p>
            <em>
              Are we doing anything to protect ourselves and the users of our
              framework against the LiteLLM-class supply-chain attack?
            </em>{" "}
            Yes, and most of it was shipped before the Snyk post existed, for
            the same reasons that post lists. SHA-pinned actions, isolated
            publish jobs with OIDC + Environment gating,{" "}
            <code>ignore-scripts</code>, zero runtime deps, a 24h release-age
            floor, the dozen <code>verify:*</code> gates, and{" "}
            <code>harden-runner</code> egress logging on every job. The playbook
            the attacker used does not have a green path through any of those.
          </p>

          <p>
            None of this is hypothetical. Open <code>.github/workflows/</code>{" "}
            in the repo, run <code>pnpm verify</code> locally, look at the
            commit SHAs on every <code>uses:</code> line. The receipts are in
            the workflow files.
          </p>
