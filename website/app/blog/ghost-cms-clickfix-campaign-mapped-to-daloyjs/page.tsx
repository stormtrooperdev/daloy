            </a>{" "}
            and asked:{" "}
            <em>are we doing anything about this, and if not, can we?</em> I
            love that question because it forces me to actually look at the
            framework instead of telling myself nice stories about it. So I
            looked. The answer was &quot;mostly yes, but there was one default I
            hadn&apos;t closed&quot;, which is a polite way of saying I missed
            it. This post is the stage-by-stage mapping plus the one-line change
            I shipped to
            <code> secureHeaders()</code> after I stopped feeling embarrassed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Short version of the incident, for context: XLab researchers found a
            campaign exploiting{" "}

            - a pre-auth SQL injection in Ghost CMS 3.24.0 → 6.19.0 - across
            more than <strong>700 domains</strong>, including Harvard, Oxford,
            Auburn, and DuckDuckGo. Ghost shipped the fix in 6.19.1 back on
            February&nbsp;19, 2026. Three months later, plenty of sites were
            still on the vulnerable version. I&apos;ve been the person who
            didn&apos;t patch in time before. It happens to everyone exactly
            once before they automate it.
          </p>

          <p>The attack chain has five distinct stages:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>SQLi</strong>: read arbitrary rows from the Ghost
              database, including the <strong>admin API keys</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Privilege escalation via stolen API key</strong>: use the
              admin key to log into the admin API as a manager.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stored XSS</strong>: inject <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>{" "}
              tags into published articles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fake Cloudflare iframe</strong>: overlay a &quot;Verify
              you are human&quot; prompt loaded from attacker infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ClickFix clipboard stuffing</strong>: when the visitor
              clicks the fake checkbox, silently call{" "}
              <code>navigator.clipboard.writeText()</code> with a PowerShell
              payload and instruct the victim to paste it into Win+R.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            DaloyJS isn&apos;t a CMS, it&apos;s an HTTP framework, so stages 1
            and 2 only matter for users who build a Ghost-shaped app on top of
            Daloy. Stages 3, 4, and 5 matter for <em>any</em> HTML surface Daloy
            serves. Here&apos;s how each stage maps to what was already in the
            box, and the one default we tightened in response to stage 5.
          </p>

          <h2>Stage 1: Pre-auth SQL injection</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Database read via injection"
            ghost="A query parameter on a public Ghost endpoint was concatenated into a SQL string. Unauthenticated attackers could dump arbitrary tables, including 'mobiledoc_revisions' and the row holding admin API keys."
            daloyjs="DaloyJS doesn't ship an ORM (zero runtime deps in @daloyjs/core), but every docs example uses parameterised queries, pg tagged templates, postgres.js, better-sqlite3 prepared statements, or Prisma. 'website/app/docs/security/sql-injection' walks through each, and explicitly calls out the 'knex.raw(`${input}`)' template-literal footgun. The Standard Schema .strict() validator on params/query/body rejects unknown shapes before the handler runs, which removes the 'unexpected JSON in a query param' attack surface that often leads to SQLi in the first place."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="typescript" code={PARAMETERIZED_SQL} />

          <h2>Stage 2: Stolen admin API key</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Privilege escalation via leaked credential"
            ghost="Ghost's admin API keys were sitting in the table the SQLi could read, and the API verified them with a non-constant-time string compare. Once stolen, the keys gave full management access, create users, edit themes, publish posts."
            daloyjs="Every bytes-vs-bytes comparison in the framework goes through 'timingSafeEqual', enforced by 'verify:secret-comparisons' at publish time, so we structurally can't reintroduce the bug. JWT verification ships an algorithm allowlist (no 'alg: none', no HS256-vs-RS256 confusion), a 2048-bit RSA floor ('weak_rsa_key'), JWKS rotation with kid-pinning, and an 'isRevoked' hook that runs LAST so forged tokens never enumerate the blocklist. The 'assertStrongSecret' guard refuses weak HMAC secrets at boot."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="typescript" code={JWT_DEFENSES} />

          <h2>Stage 3: Stored XSS via admin API</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Injected <script> on every article view"
            ghost="With the admin key in hand, attackers edited live articles and embedded a lightweight loader script. Because Ghost renders post bodies as HTML, the script ran in the site's own origin on every page view."
            daloyjs="The default 'content-security-policy: default-src \\'self\\'; frame-ancestors \\'none\\'' refuses inline scripts and cross-origin script sources out of the box. The CSP nonce + Trusted Types path ('csp-nonces-and-trusted-types-without-tears' blog post) lets you serve necessary inline scripts without 'unsafe-inline'. 'frame-ancestors \\'none\\'' blocks the page from being embedded by an attacker, and the dual-knob refuse-to-boot guard in secureHeaders() refuses to construct if you disable BOTH X-Frame-Options AND frame-ancestors at once. For user-generated HTML specifically, the response-body schema validator + .strict() on body params + 'isForbiddenObjectKey' parser guard reduce the surface where unsanitised HTML can sneak in."
          />

          <h2>Stage 4: Fake Cloudflare iframe overlay</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="Cross-origin iframe loaded over the article"
            ghost="The injected loader fetched a second-stage script that built an iframe pointing at the attacker's 'verify-you-are-human' page and overlaid it on top of the article."
            daloyjs="The default CSP 'frame-ancestors none' stops attacker pages from embedding YOUR Daloy app. The mirror, stopping YOUR Daloy app from embedding attacker pages, is a one-line opt-in: pass a 'frame-src' allowlist (e.g. just 'self') in secureHeaders() contentSecurityPolicy directives. Combined with COOP: same-origin and CORP: same-origin (both defaults), this neutralises the cross-window communication channel the overlay needs."
          />

          <h2>Stage 5: ClickFix clipboard stuffing</h2>

          <StageCard
            stage="navigator.clipboard.writeText() called silently"
            ghost="When the visitor clicks the fake 'Verify you are human' checkbox (which counts as user activation), the page silently calls navigator.clipboard.writeText() with a base64-encoded PowerShell one-liner, then displays 'Press Win+R, paste, hit Enter'. Most victims paste without reading. I would probably paste without reading on a bad day too."
            daloyjs="This is the gap I missed. CSP doesn't cover the Clipboard API, it controls WHERE script can come from, not WHAT script can do once it's running. The right defence is the Permissions-Policy header, and 'clipboard-write' has been in the spec for years. I just hadn't put it in the default string. Now I have: secureHeaders() ships 'clipboard-write=()' alongside the existing camera/microphone/geolocation denials. Override only if your HTML surface legitimately needs 'Copy' buttons."
          />

          <CodeBlock language="javascript" code={CLIPBOARD_WRITE} />

          <h2>The new default, in full</h2>

          <CodeBlock language="text" code={DEFAULT_HEADERS} />

          <p>
            The only changed line is the <code>permissions-policy</code> one;
            everything else has been the default for releases. With{" "}
            <code>clipboard-write=()</code> in place, even if attacker JS slips
            past your CSP and runs in your origin, calling{" "}
            <code>navigator.clipboard.writeText()</code> throws a{" "}
            <code>SecurityError</code> before a single byte hits the clipboard.
            Iframes inherit the parent&apos;s Permissions-Policy and can never
            escalate past it, so the &quot;fake Cloudflare iframe&quot; from
            stage 4 also can&apos;t fall back to writing its own clipboard if it
            ever managed to load.
          </p>

          <p>
            If your app is a CMS, an admin UI, or anything else where users
            click &quot;Copy&quot; buttons, opt back in explicitly, the
            override fully replaces the default (no merging), so be deliberate:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock
            language="typescript"
            code={`import { secureHeaders } from "@daloyjs/core";

app.use(secureHeaders({
  // Keep the camera/mic/geo denials, allow clipboard-write to self.
  permissionsPolicy:
    "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), clipboard-write=(self)",
}));`}
          />

          <h2>What this attack would have needed to do on a DaloyJS app</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Hand-roll a SQL string with user input, the docs example uses
              parameterised queries, and <code>.strict()</code> schemas reject
              the unexpected-shape inputs that often start SQLi.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compare the stolen admin key with <code>===</code> instead of{" "}
              <code>timingSafeEqual</code>: blocked by{" "}
              <code>verify:secret-comparisons</code> at publish time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Render attacker HTML without CSP, the default{" "}
              <code>default-src &apos;self&apos;</code> + Trusted Types path
              refuses inline + cross-origin scripts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let attacker iframes load, opt in to <code>frame-src</code>{" "}
              allowlist; <code>frame-ancestors &apos;none&apos;</code> already
              stops the inverse (your page being embedded).
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow <code>navigator.clipboard.writeText()</code> from injected
              JS, blocked by the new{" "}
              <code>permissions-policy: clipboard-write=()</code> default.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>What you should do in your own DaloyJS app</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Update to the release that ships this default and don&apos;t
              override <code>permissionsPolicy</code> unless you genuinely need
              clipboard write. The override fully replaces the default, so
              re-list the camera/mic/geo denials if you set your own string.
            </li>
            <li>
              For HTML routes that render user-generated content (comments,
              wikis, articles), turn on the CSP nonce + Trusted Types path (see
              the{" "}

              on the server.
            </li>

              shows the four common drivers and the one template-literal footgun
              to avoid.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you mint admin API keys, run them through{" "}
              <code>timingSafeEqual</code> on every check and put a short-lived
              JWT on top with the algorithm allowlist + revocation hook.
              Long-lived shared secrets that compare with <code>===</code> are
              exactly what made the Ghost compromise so destructive.

              Are we doing anything to protect ourselves and the users of our
              framework against the Ghost CMS / ClickFix campaign?

            Stages 1 through 4 were already covered, parameterised queries in
            every docs example, <code>timingSafeEqual</code> + JWT alg allowlist
            + revocation hook, CSP <code>default-src &apos;self&apos;</code>{" "}
            with the Trusted-Types path, and{" "}
            <code>frame-ancestors &apos;none&apos;</code>. Stage 5, the silent
            clipboard write that makes the whole social engineering trick land, 
            wasn&apos;t. So I changed the default. Add{" "}
            <code>clipboard-write=()</code> to the Permissions-Policy string,
            write the regression test, document the override pattern, ship it.
          </p>

          <p>
            That&apos;s the whole job of secure-by-default in my head: when the
            threat model moves, the default moves with it, and apps that already
            trust the framework inherit the fix on the next dependency bump
            without reading a CVE or running a migration script. If you have to
            read a security blog before your app is safe, the framework already
            failed you. I&apos;d rather feel a little dumb for missing this one
            line than ship a framework that quietly leaves it to you.
