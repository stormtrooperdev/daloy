              Aikido&apos;s &quot;WTF is Vibe Coding Security&quot;
            </a>{" "}
            and the question was, again, the only one worth asking:{" "}
            <em>so are we doing anything about this?</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            For the unfamiliar: <strong>vibe coding</strong> is when someone, 
            often someone who is not a developer, describes what they want in
            English and ships whatever the model writes.{" "}
            <strong>Agentic coding</strong> is the same thing with the model
            also installing the dependencies, running the tests, and pushing the
            PR. The Aikido post lists the usual scary outcomes: SQL injection,
            path traversal, hardcoded secrets, an admin route left mounted on
            the public app (the &quot;Tea app&quot; story), and an AI agent that
            deleted a production database while &quot;lying about unit
            tests&quot; (the Replit / SaaStr story).
          </p>

          <p>
            I read it, opened DaloyJS, and went through each risk to see what we
            already block, what needs one opt-in line, and where we honestly
            can&apos;t help. Below is that mapping. The TL;DR: if a sales rep
            uses Claude to scaffold a DaloyJS app at 1am, the boring stuff, 
            body limits, prototype pollution, header splitting, path traversal,
            secret-shaped logs, is on before they type their first prompt. What
            they still have to <em>choose</em> is which routes need auth and
            where the admin surface lives. Those are policy, not defaults.
          </p>

          <h2>Risk 1: SQL injection</h2>

          <RiskCard
            risk="Aikido: 'SQL injections, path traversal, hardcoded secrets.'"
            framework="Standard Schema (Zod / Valibot) validation is a route-level requirement, not an afterthought.

            user="Pick a real ORM. Don't write template-string SQL. The framework will not stop you from doing the wrong thing inside your handler, but it will hand you a fully-typed, validated input object so you have no excuse."

          <p>
            DaloyJS doesn&apos;t ship an ORM. That&apos;s deliberate, pinning
            one ORM would be the same kind of opinionation that gets frameworks
            in trouble. What it does ship is a route shape where the input is
            validated <em>before</em> your handler runs:

            user="Run 'pnpm verify' in your project's CI. The create-daloy templates ship the workflow. Don't disable it because a dependency 'needs' a postinstall, that's the attack."

            . The shorter version: attackers do not need a 0-day if they can
            ship a malicious <code>postinstall</code>, and AI agents do not
            inspect <code>scripts</code> blocks before running{" "}
            <code>npm install</code>. The gate that says &quot;no lifecycle
            scripts at all&quot; is the one that stops the next{" "}

            project.

            shipped an internal-only deploy and the breach would not have
            happened. I am not claiming the framework would have <em>forced</em>{" "}
            them to, policy is policy, but the path of least resistance in
            DaloyJS is the safe one.

            user="Write the schema. The framework will hold the line."

          <p>
            This is the same pattern as Risk 1, applied to <em>every</em> input
            surface, not just bodies. The router itself is the sanitization
            layer, there is no &quot;remember to call zod.parse&quot;
            convention. If a route omits a body schema and declares a body
            content type, the build complains. If the body schema rejects, the
            handler never runs.

            . The point of scaffolding AGENTS.md is exactly the
            &quot;PromptBOM&quot; idea the Aikido post pitches at the end, give
            the agent provenance and rules <em>before</em> it generates, not
            after.

          <p>
            The article&apos;s most useful line: &quot;Treat AI code like a
            junior developer wrote it.&quot; Translated into framework defaults,
            that means the dangerous things have to be off when nobody
            remembered to turn them off. That&apos;s the constructor:

          <h2>What we honestly do not do</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We do not stop you from <code>rm -rf</code> your production
              database from inside a handler. If you give the agent
              <code> DATABASE_URL </code> with destructive privileges, the
              framework cannot save you. Use a read-replica for the agent. Use
              least-privilege DB roles.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not scan the AI-generated code for logic flaws, the article
              is right that scanners catch known patterns and miss business
              logic. We give you the structured surface (typed routes, typed
              client, OpenAPI) so a reviewer or a SAST tool has something to
              bite into.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not enforce authentication on every route. We can&apos;t, 
              some routes are deliberately public. What we give you is{" "}
              <code>jwt()</code>, <code>basicAuth()</code>,{" "}
              <code>bearerAuth()</code>, <code>session()</code>, and an{" "}
              <Link href="/docs/security/auth-slice">auth-slice pattern</Link>{" "}
              so the choice is visible per route.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not provide an AI moderation layer or a runtime
              intrusion-detection system. Daloy gives you the structured event
              stream a detector needs; the detector itself is your call.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The vibe-coder prompt that produces a defensible app</h2>

          <CodeBlock language="ts" code={VIBE_CODER_CHECKLIST} />

          <p>
            That paragraph plus <code>pnpm create daloy@latest</code> is the
            entire setup. The scaffolded project ships with the verify gates
            wired into CI, the AGENTS.md the model needs, the security docs
            linked from the README, and the secure-by-default constructor. The
            sales rep at 1am has to actively work to disable any of it.
          </p>

          <h2>The honest answer to the original question</h2>

          <p>
            <em>Are we doing anything about vibe coding security?</em> Yes, the
            framework was designed assuming the person writing the handler
            either doesn&apos;t know or doesn&apos;t care about the security
            layer, and the defaults reflect that. The Aikido post&apos;s
            shopping list of risks maps almost one-for-one to a primitive that
            already exists in DaloyJS today. The few items that don&apos;t map
            are the ones no framework can own, pick an IdP, lock down the DB
            role, don&apos;t hand the prod creds to the agent, review the
            commits.
          </p>

          <p>
            The vibes can stay good. Just point them at a framework that
            won&apos;t let them ship the obvious mistakes.
          </p>
