      <h1>Scheduled tasks (in-process cron)</h1>
      <p>
        As of <strong>0.37.0</strong> DaloyJS ships a <strong>queue-agnostic
        schedule primitive</strong>: run periodic work inside <em>this</em>{" "}
        process on a fixed interval or a cron expression. It is the in-process
        counterpart to an external job queue &mdash; reach for it for cache
        sweeps, token refresh, reconciliation, and other housekeeping, not for
        distributed fan-out. It has zero runtime dependencies and three
        properties a production scheduler needs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexible schedules</strong> &mdash; fixed intervals
          (<code>intervalMs</code>) or 5-field cron expressions
          (<code>cron</code>, with <code>@hourly</code>/<code>@daily</code>/…
          aliases and an optional IANA <code>timeZone</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Single-flight</strong> &mdash; a task never overlaps itself.
          If a tick fires while the previous run is still in progress, the tick
          is skipped (and counted), so a slow task can never pile up unbounded
          concurrent runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Graceful shutdown</strong> &mdash; <code>app.cron()</code>{" "}
          ties the scheduler to the app lifecycle: on shutdown it stops arming
          new runs, awaits in-flight runs, and aborts their{" "}
          <code>AbortSignal</code> if they outlast the grace period. Timers are{" "}
          <code>unref</code>&apos;d, so a scheduler never keeps an idle process
          alive on its own.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick start with <code>app.cron()</code></h2>
      <p>
        The easiest entry point is <code>app.cron()</code>. The first call
        lazily creates an app-managed <code>Scheduler</code>, starts it, and
        registers the shutdown drain for you.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`import { createApp } from "@daloyjs/core";

const app = createApp();

// Every hour, on the hour.
app.cron({ name: "purge-sessions", cron: "0 * * * *" }, async ({ signal }) => {
  await purgeExpiredSessions({ signal });
});

// Every 30 seconds, starting immediately.
app.cron(
  { name: "heartbeat", intervalMs: 30_000, runOnStart: true },
  () => publishHeartbeat(),
);`}
      />
      <p>
        Inspect or manually trigger tasks through{" "}
        <code>app.scheduledTasks</code> (the underlying <code>Scheduler</code>):
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`app.scheduledTasks?.list();              // execution stats for every task
app.scheduledTasks?.getState("heartbeat"); // one task's snapshot
await app.scheduledTasks?.runNow("purge-sessions"); // out-of-band run`}
      />

      <h2>Cron expressions</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>cron</code> field accepts a standard 5-field expression
        (<code>minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week</code>) with
        wildcards, lists (<code>1,15,30</code>), ranges (<code>1-5</code>), steps
        (<code>*/5</code>), and case-insensitive month/day names. Day-of-week
        accepts both <code>0</code> and <code>7</code> for Sunday. The named
        aliases <code>@yearly</code>, <code>@monthly</code>,{" "}
        <code>@weekly</code>, <code>@daily</code>, and <code>@hourly</code> are
        also supported.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`app.cron({ name: "nightly", cron: "0 2 * * *" }, run);          // 02:00 daily
app.cron({ name: "weekday-9am", cron: "0 9 * * 1-5" }, run);    // 09:00 Mon–Fri
app.cron({ name: "quarter-hour", cron: "*/15 * * * *" }, run);  // every 15 min
app.cron({ name: "first-of-month", cron: "@monthly" }, run);    // 00:00 on the 1st`}
      />
      <p>
        Cron expressions evaluate in UTC by default. Pass an IANA{" "}
        <code>timeZone</code> to schedule against a wall clock:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`app.cron(
  { name: "ny-open", cron: "30 9 * * 1-5", timeZone: "America/New_York" },
  run,
);`}
      />
      <p>
        Parsing is purely arithmetic (no backtracking regular expressions), and
        a malformed or unsatisfiable expression (for example{" "}
        <code>0 0 30 2 *</code> — the 30th of February) throws a{" "}
        <code>CronParseError</code> at registration time, not silently at
        runtime.
      </p>

      <h2>Single-flight &amp; overruns</h2>
      <p>
        Schedules are <strong>fixed-rate</strong>: the next tick is armed before
        the current run starts. If a run outlasts its interval, the overlapping
        tick is <em>skipped</em> rather than started concurrently, and the skip
        is counted in <code>getState(name).skipped</code>. This guarantees at
        most one concurrent run per task — a slow task degrades to &ldquo;runs
        back-to-back&rdquo; instead of fanning out.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`const state = app.scheduledTasks!.getState("purge-sessions")!;
state.runs;            // total completed runs
state.failures;        // runs that threw or timed out
state.skipped;         // ticks skipped due to overrun
state.running;         // is a run in progress right now?
state.lastDurationMs;  // wall-clock duration of the last run
state.nextRunAt;       // epoch ms of the next scheduled run`}
      />

      <h2>Per-run timeouts</h2>
      <p>
        Set <code>timeoutMs</code> to bound a run. When it elapses the run&apos;s{" "}
        <code>signal</code> is aborted; forward it to your I/O so the handler
        unwinds promptly. A timed-out run is recorded as a failure and reported
        to <code>onError</code> with <code>timedOut: true</code>.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`app.cron(
  {
    name: "sync",
    cron: "*/5 * * * *",
    timeoutMs: 60_000,
    onError: (err, info) => metrics.increment("cron.failed", { task: info.name }),
  },
  async ({ signal }) => {
    await reconcile({ signal });
  },
);`}
      />

      <h2>Using the <code>Scheduler</code> directly</h2>
      <p>
        For lifecycles you manage yourself (workers, scripts, tests), construct
        a <code>Scheduler</code> and drive it directly. It accepts an injectable
        clock and timer primitives, which makes it fully deterministic under
        test.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`import { Scheduler } from "@daloyjs/core";

const scheduler = new Scheduler({ logger });
scheduler.define({ name: "cleanup", intervalMs: 60_000 }, ({ signal }) =>
  sweep({ signal }),
);
scheduler.start();

// On shutdown — wait up to 5s for in-flight runs, then abort:
process.on("SIGTERM", () => scheduler.stop(5_000));`}
      />
      <p>
        The cron utilities are exported standalone too:{" "}
        <code>parseCron(expr)</code> compiles an expression to its field sets,
        and <code>nextCronRun(expr, after?, timeZone?)</code> returns the next
        matching <code>Date</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>When to reach for a real queue instead</h2>
      <p>
        This scheduler runs in-process: each instance of your app runs its own
        timers. That is exactly what you want for idempotent maintenance, but
        for work that must run <em>exactly once</em> across a horizontally-scaled
        fleet — or that must survive a process restart — use a durable queue or
        a leader-elected external scheduler and have the elected instance call{" "}
        <code>runNow()</code>. The single-flight guarantee is per-process, not
        cluster-wide.
      </p>
    </>
