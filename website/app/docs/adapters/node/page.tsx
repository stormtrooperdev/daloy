      <h1>Node.js</h1>
      <p>
        The Node adapter runs your REST API on the built-in{" "}
        <code>node:http</code> server. It&apos;s the default target for
        containers, VMs, and any Node-based PaaS (Heroku, Railway, Render,
        Fly.io). Use it when you control the process, long-lived, observable,
        and easy to debug.
      </p>

      <h2>When to choose Node</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You deploy to a container, VM, or Node PaaS (no per-request billing).
        </li>
        <li>
          You need <code>node:*</code> modules (filesystem, child processes,
          native addons).
        </li>
        <li>You want the broadest npm package compatibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scaffold</h2>
      <p>
        The fastest way to start is the <code>node-basic</code> template. It
        ships with TypeScript, pnpm workspaces, a <code>/healthz</code> route,
        graceful shutdown, and Hey&nbsp;API codegen wired up.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="bash"
        code={`pnpm create daloy@latest my-api --template node-basic
cd my-api
pnpm dev    # hot-reload via daloy dev`}
      />

      <h2>Install</h2>
      <p>
        Requires <strong>Node.js 24 LTS or newer</strong>. The adapter ships
        with <code>@daloyjs/core</code>; no extra dependency.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pnpm add @daloyjs/core`} />

      <h2>Minimal server</h2>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`// src/server.ts
import { serve } from "@daloyjs/core/node";
import { app } from "./app.js";

const { port, close } = serve(app, {
  port: Number(process.env.PORT ?? 3000),
  hostname: "0.0.0.0",
  connectionTimeoutMs: 30_000,
  shutdownTimeoutMs: 10_000,
  handleSignals: true,       // SIGTERM / SIGINT trigger graceful shutdown
  maxHeaderBytes: 16 * 1024, // 16 KiB cap (default)
  trustProxy: false,         // set true only behind a trusted reverse proxy
  maxConnections: 200,       // optional: cap concurrent sockets (off by default)
});

console.log(\`listening on :\${port}\`);

// later - drain in-flight requests, then close
await close();`}
      />

      <h2>What the adapter wires for you</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>requestTimeout</code>, <code>headersTimeout</code>, and{" "}
          <code>keepAliveTimeout</code> set to safe production values.
        </li>
        <li>
          SIGTERM / SIGINT handlers that call <code>server.close()</code>{" "}
          followed by <code>server.closeAllConnections()</code> after{" "}
          <code>shutdownTimeoutMs</code>: the pattern that became stable in
          Node 18.2 and is recommended on Node 24+.
        </li>
        <li>
          When <code>trustProxy: true</code>, the adapter reads{" "}
          <code>x-forwarded-proto</code> and <code>x-forwarded-host</code> when
          constructing the request URL. Leave it off unless TLS is terminated at
          a known proxy you control.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Behind a load balancer</h2>
      <p>Two rules to avoid the classic 502/504 race:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make your load balancer&apos;s idle timeout <strong>greater</strong>{" "}
          than DaloyJS&apos;s <code>requestTimeoutMs</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make DaloyJS&apos;s <code>keepAliveTimeout</code>{" "}
          <strong>greater</strong> than the load balancer&apos;s, the Node
          adapter does this for you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Graceful degradation under overload</h2>
      <p>
        Steady-state throughput is only half the story. Once a Node process is
        pushed <em>past</em> saturation, the multi-second part of the tail
        latency no longer lives in your handler, it lives in the{" "}
        <strong>accept queue</strong>, where overflow connections sit waiting
        for the event loop to get to them. A connection sweep makes this
        visible: at high concurrency an unbounded server&apos;s p99.9 can{" "}
        <em>cliff</em> from tens of milliseconds into the multi-second range,
        even though median throughput still looks healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cheapest fix that actually works is{" "}
        <strong>connection-layer admission control</strong>:{" "}
        <code>maxConnections</code> forwards to Node&apos;s{" "}
        <code>server.maxConnections</code>, so once the cap is reached the
        server refuses additional sockets <strong>at accept time</strong>{" "}
        instead of queuing them into the event loop. Admitted traffic stays
        fast; overflow is rejected fast. It is <strong>off by default</strong>{" "}
        and sits off the request hot path, so it adds no per-request cost.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`import { serve } from "@daloyjs/core/node";
import { app } from "./app.js";

serve(app, {
  port: 3000,
  // Keep concurrency near the process's measured sweet spot. Above this,
  // overflow sockets are refused at accept time rather than queued into
  // multi-second tail latencies. Leave unset for Node's default (unbounded).
  maxConnections: Number(process.env.MAX_CONNECTIONS ?? 200),
});`}
      />
      <p>
        Pick the cap empirically: run a connection sweep against your real
        routes and set <code>maxConnections</code> at (or just below) the
        concurrency where p99/p99.9 latency stays in its healthy range. The
        right value is workload-specific, CPU-bound JSON validation saturates
        at a very different point than I/O-bound proxying.
      </p>

      <h3>Pair it with an upstream gateway</h3>
      <p>
        When the cap is hit, the overflow socket is refused at the TCP layer, 
        the client sees a connection reset, not an HTTP response. In production
        you want a load balancer or API gateway in front that translates that
        refusal into a clean <code>503 Service Unavailable</code> with a{" "}
        <code>Retry-After</code> header, so well-behaved clients back off and
        retry instead of hammering a saturated process.
      </p>

      <h3>Pair it with loadShedding</h3>
      <p>
        <code>maxConnections</code> and{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/security/lifecycle-leftovers">
          <code>loadShedding()</code>
        </Link>{" "}
        solve different layers of the same problem and compose well:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <code>maxConnections</code>
          </strong>{" "}
          (connection layer) caps how many sockets are ever accepted, keeping
          the event loop in its measured sweet spot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <code>loadShedding()</code>
          </strong>{" "}
          (application layer) sheds requests when an honest overload signal, 
          event-loop <em>delay</em> (queue backlog) or in-flight concurrency, 
          trips a threshold.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A note on the load-shedding signal: event-loop{" "}
        <strong>utilization</strong> is the wrong knob for an always-busy,
        CPU-bound server, which can sit near 100% utilization while perfectly
        healthy and would shed good traffic. Event-loop <strong>delay</strong>{" "}
        (how far behind the loop has fallen) is the honest overload signal.
        Likewise, <code>requestTimeoutMs</code> alone does <em>not</em> fix the
        cliff: it wraps handler execution, not the accept-queue wait where the
        multi-second tail actually lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treat <code>maxConnections</code> as a resilience/latency lever, not a
        throughput lever, under overload it turns &ldquo;everyone waits
        seconds&rdquo; into &ldquo;admitted traffic stays fast, overflow is
        refused fast.&rdquo;
      </p>

        <li>
          Don&apos;t put <code>process.exit()</code> in a SIGTERM handler, let{" "}

          the timeout.

          Set <code>hostname: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;</code> in containers; Node
