        <strong>Think of it like…</strong> the paperwork side of a building
        safety inspection. The bricks (technical controls — TLS, auth, audit
        logs, redaction, rate limits) are already in the framework; this page
        shows the inspector exactly which brick satisfies which line on the SOC
        2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA / GDPR / PCI / NIS2 / DORA form so you stop
        re-deriving the mapping every audit cycle.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        DaloyJS is a backend framework, not a managed service, so it cannot
        certify your deployment for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS,
        NIS2, DORA, or the UK Cyber Security and Resilience Bill on its own.
        What it <em>can</em> do is provide the technical controls each of those
        frameworks expects from the application layer so that the controls live
        in source code where they are reviewed, tested, and version-pinned
        &mdash; rather than in a checklist that drifts away from production.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page maps DaloyJS&apos;s built-in primitives to the control
        families auditors actually ask about. The mapping is informational, not
        a legal opinion: organizational controls (employee training, vendor
        management, physical security, access reviews) remain the
        operator&apos;s responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Shared technical controls</h2>
      <p>
        Most frameworks ask for the same handful of application-layer controls
        under different names. DaloyJS ships them by default.

        SOC 2 maps to the Trust Services Criteria. DaloyJS contributes mostly to
        the <strong>Security (Common Criteria)</strong> category and partially
        to Availability and Confidentiality. Privacy and Processing Integrity
        also get coverage when you turn the schemas into binding contracts.

      <p>
        Picking the 2022 revision (rather than 2013/2017) is the safer call for
        new certifications &mdash; it adds explicit controls for secure coding,
        threat intelligence, web filtering, and configuration management that
        DaloyJS already covers out of the box. The mapping below is the short
        version your auditor can use as evidence for the application-layer
        controls.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>A.5.7 Threat intelligence</strong> &mdash; OpenSSF Scorecard,
          OSV-Scanner, CodeQL, Dependabot, and the published GHSA advisory flow
          feed the framework&apos;s own intel loop; downstream apps inherit the
          same signals through <code>create-daloy --with-ci</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.5.23 Information security for use of cloud services</strong>{" "}
          &mdash; runtime-parity audits keep behavior identical across Node,
          Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, and Vercel Edge so the cloud provider
          is a deployment choice, not a security trade-off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.5.30 ICT readiness for business continuity</strong> &mdash;

          Dependabot.
        </li>
        <li>

          ), not just documented.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.8.15 Logging</strong> &mdash; structured logger, request-id
          correlation, PII redaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.8.16 Monitoring activities</strong> &mdash; Server-Timing
          headers, OpenTelemetry spans, and the structured-log pipeline give
          downstream SIEM/observability tools the signals they need; rate-limit
          rejections, schema-validation failures, and JWT rejections all surface
          as discrete log events with a stable request-id.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.8.23 Web filtering</strong> &mdash;{" "}
          <code>fetchGuard()</code> enforces an egress allow-list pattern from
          inside the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.8.24 Use of cryptography</strong> &mdash; algorithm

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A.8.26 Application security requirements</strong> &mdash;

        <li>
          <strong>A.8.32 Change management</strong> &mdash; SHA-pinned GitHub

          provenance-signed npm publishes, and the verify-* CI gates listed in{" "}

          identification via session/JWT subject claim; automatic logoff via
          session TTL; encryption at the cookie layer with signed and rotated
          keys.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>§ 164.312(b) Audit Controls</strong> &mdash; structured logs
          with request-id, route, status, latency, and user-id (when
          authenticated) so a downstream log pipeline can satisfy retention and
          tamper-evidence requirements (those still need to be configured at the
          log sink).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>§ 164.312(c) Integrity</strong> &mdash; HMAC for webhook

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>§ 164.312(e) Transmission Security</strong> &mdash; HSTS and

          CDN, platform) is out of the framework&apos;s scope.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practical PHI hygiene.</strong> Add field-level redaction in

          <strong>Article 30 records of processing</strong> &mdash; OpenAPI is

      <h2>PCI-DSS v4.0 (software-side controls)</h2>
      <p>
        DaloyJS&apos;s payments documentation already calls out the SAQ scope
        consequences of touching a Primary Account Number (PAN) directly. The
        framework helps with the software-side requirements of v4.0:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Req 2 secure configurations</strong> &mdash; secure-by-default
          headers, content-type allow-listing, and the boot guards that
          fail-closed on insecure config.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Req 6.2 secure software development</strong> &mdash;
          schema-validated inputs, prototype-pollution-safe JSON parsing, header
          sanitization, path-traversal-safe router, prepared-statement guidance
          for every ORM in{" "}
          <a href="/docs/security/sql-injection">SQL injection</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Req 6.3 manage vulnerabilities</strong> &mdash; SECURITY.md
          SLA, GHSA evidence, dependency-graph monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Req 6.4 protect public-facing web applications</strong>{" "}
          &mdash; CSRF, secure headers, rate limiting, request-id correlation.
        </li>
        <li>

          session/JWT helpers with algorithm allow-listing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Req 10 log and monitor</strong> &mdash; structured logs with

          obligations live at the log sink.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SAQ scope.</strong> The strongest control here is{" "}
          <em>not seeing the PAN at all</em>. The payments docs (Stripe,
          Authorize.Net, Square) document the redirect/hosted-fields patterns
          that keep you in SAQ-A or SAQ-A-EP rather than SAQ-D.

      <h2>NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) and the EU CRA</h2>
      <p>
        NIS2 Article 21 lists the cybersecurity risk-management measures
        essential and important entities must adopt. The Cyber Resilience Act
        adds analogous obligations on the vendor side. Both increasingly show up
        as upstream patch-SLA clauses in procurement.
      </p>

      <h3>Are you in scope? (NIS2 self-assessment)</h3>
      <p>
        DaloyJS itself is open-source framework software and is not a regulated
        entity. NIS2 obligations attach to the operator running the service, not
        to the framework author &mdash; so the first question for any team
        building on Daloy is whether the directive applies to <em>them</em>.
        Aikido&apos;s{" "}
        <a

        >
          &ldquo;NIS2: Who is affected?&rdquo;
        </a>{" "}
        write-up summarizes the sector and size tests; the checklist below is
        the operator-friendly version, oriented around the workloads people
        actually build with this framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are likely in scope if <strong>all three</strong> of the following
        are true:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>You operate in the EU.</strong> NIS2 applies to entities
          providing services <em>in</em> the Union, even when the entity itself
          is established outside the EU (Article 26 establishment rules apply
          for cloud, data centers, CDN, managed services, MSSPs, online
          marketplaces, online search, social networks, and DNS providers).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your sector is named in Annex I or Annex II.</strong>{" "}
          <em>Annex I (essential, &ldquo;high criticality&rdquo;)</em> covers
          energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructure, health,
          drinking water, waste water, digital infrastructure (IXPs, DNS, TLDs,
          cloud computing, data center services, CDN, trust services, electronic
          communications), ICT service management (B2B, including MSPs and
          MSSPs), and public administration.{" "}
          <em>Annex II (important, &ldquo;other critical&rdquo;)</em> covers
          postal &amp; courier, waste management, manufacture and distribution
          of chemicals, food production/processing/distribution, manufacturing
          (medical devices, computers/electronics, electrical equipment,
          machinery, motor vehicles, other transport equipment), digital
          providers (online marketplaces, online search engines, social
          networks), and research organisations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You meet the size threshold</strong> &mdash; medium-sized or
          larger per the EU 2003/361 SME definition:{" "}
          <strong>&ge; 50 staff</strong> or{" "}
          <strong>&gt; &euro;10 million</strong> annual turnover <em>or</em>{" "}
          balance sheet. Smaller entities can also be pulled in regardless of
          size when they are a sole provider in a member state, when a
          disruption would have a significant impact on public safety / security
          / health, when they are a qualified trust service provider, TLD name
          registry, DNS service provider, or public electronic communications
          provider, or when the member state has designated them as critical
          under Article 2(2). Public administration entities are in scope under
          separate Article 2(2)(f) rules.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The two tiers carry different penalty caps and supervisory regimes:{" "}
        <strong>essential entities</strong> face up to{" "}
        <strong>&euro;10 M or 2% of global annual turnover</strong> (whichever
        is higher) and ex-ante supervision; <strong>important entities</strong>{" "}
        face up to <strong>&euro;7 M or 1.4% of global annual turnover</strong>{" "}
        and ex-post supervision. Article 20 also makes{" "}
        <strong>management bodies personally accountable</strong> for approving
        the risk-management measures and undergoing cybersecurity training
        &mdash; that is the clause that has been generating the most attention,
        because the responsibility cannot be delegated to the security team.
        Member-state transposition deadline was <strong>17 October 2024</strong>
        ; most member states have since published national laws with their own
        registration and reporting portals (the national CSIRT and the
        single-entry point under Article 23(4)).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you concluded you are in scope, the Article 21 measure list below
        plus the EU CRA evidence pack further down are what you point your own
        auditor at for the framework layer. Most workloads built on Daloy land
        in Annex I &ldquo;digital infrastructure&rdquo; (cloud / data center /
        CDN), Annex I &ldquo;ICT service management&rdquo; (MSP / MSSP), or
        Annex II &ldquo;digital providers&rdquo; (online marketplace / search /
        social network) &mdash; the technical controls in this page were built
        specifically so a team in those sectors does not have to reconstruct the
        framework-layer evidence from scratch.
      </p>

      <h3>Article 21 risk-management measures (framework-layer mapping)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Article 20 governance &mdash; management body approves the
            risk-management measures and undergoes cybersecurity training
          </strong>{" "}
          &mdash; an organizational obligation on the consumer (cannot be
          delegated to the security team). The framework layer makes the
          underlying evidence reviewable: every guardrail listed below lives in
          source and is enforced by <code>pnpm verify:*</code>, so the
          management body can be shown version-pinned, auditable proof rather
          than a slide deck.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Article 21(2)(a) policies on risk analysis and security of

          &mdash; the secure-by-default baseline plus the boot-guard
          enforcement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Article 21(2)(b) incident handling</strong> &mdash;
          SECURITY.md publishes the response targets, escalation contacts, and
          GHSA evidence format.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Article 21(2)(d) supply-chain security</strong> &mdash; npm
          provenance, SBOM, SHA-pinned third-party Actions, lockfile-source
          verification, <code>ignore-scripts</code> by default in scaffolded
          projects.
        </li>
        <li>

            acquisition, development, and maintenance
          </strong>{" "}
          &mdash; the CI bundle from <code>create-daloy --with-ci</code> turns
          CodeQL, Scorecard, zizmor, Dependabot, and CODEOWNERS on out of the
          box.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Article 21(2)(g) basic cyber hygiene practices</strong>{" "}
          &mdash; documented patterns for sessions, CSRF, SSRF, SQL/command
          injection, and admin-panel hardening; opinionated runtime protections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Article 21(2)(h) use of cryptography</strong> &mdash;
          algorithm allow-listing, timing-safe comparisons, HMAC algorithm
          prefix parsing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Article 23 incident reporting (24 h early warning, 72 h
            notification, 1-month final report to the national CSIRT or
            competent authority)
          </strong>{" "}
          &mdash; this is the consumer&apos;s obligation, but the framework
          ships the technical substrate: per-request structured logs with
          correlated request IDs, OpenTelemetry-shaped spans, and plugin
          lifecycle hooks (rate-limit, auth-failure, SSRF-block, body-limit,
          timeout, <code>onShutdown</code>) suitable for feeding the
          regulator-facing notification pipeline within the statutory window.

          This mapping is informational and is not a legal opinion. DORA
          conformity for a regulated financial entity or for a designated
          critical ICT third-party service provider remains the operator&apos;s
          responsibility; the evidence above exists so the framework layer of
          that dossier does not have to be reconstructed from scratch. Critical
          ICT third-party service provider designation (Article 31) and the
          resulting Lead Overseer oversight regime are out of scope for an
          open-source framework.
        </em>
      </p>

      <h2>Operator responsibilities the framework cannot cover</h2>
      <p>
        Be upfront about this when you talk to your auditor &mdash; conflating
        application controls with platform or organizational controls is the
        fastest way to lose credibility:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>TLS termination, key management, KMS/HSM choice</strong> live
          at your load balancer, CDN, or platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encryption at rest, backup, disaster recovery</strong> live at
          the data store and infrastructure layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identity provider, MFA enrollment, account recovery</strong>{" "}
          live at the IdP (Cognito, Entra ID, Auth0, Okta, Clerk). The framework
          consumes the resulting tokens; it does not run the IdP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Log retention, immutability, SIEM forwarding</strong> live at
          the log sink. The framework emits the structured logs; how long they
          live and who can delete them is a pipeline concern.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Vendor management, employee training, access reviews, background
            checks, physical security
          </strong>{" "}
          are organizational controls. No framework can produce evidence for
          those.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Data-processing agreements, standard contractual clauses, transfer
            impact assessments
          </strong>{" "}
          are legal artifacts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Suggested artifact pack for an audit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The generated <code>openapi.json</code> as the canonical inventory of
          every public endpoint.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>sbom.json</code> emitted by{" "}
          <code>scripts/generate-sbom.ts</code> for the framework version you
          ship.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your own application&apos;s lockfile plus a recent{" "}
          <code>pnpm audit --prod</code> output.
        </li>
        <li>
          The release&apos;s npm provenance attestation (visible on the package
          page) and the matching GitHub Security Advisory entries.
        </li>
        <li>
          A short README mapping your routes to data classes (PII / PHI /
          cardholder data / none) so the auditor can verify the redaction
          configuration matches reality.
