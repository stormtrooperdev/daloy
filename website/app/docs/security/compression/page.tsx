      <h1>Compression middleware</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Think of it like…</strong> vacuum-sealing parcels for shipping:
        smaller, cheaper, faster to deliver. But you never vacuum-seal anything
        with a return address visible through the wrap (cookies, auth headers,
        CSRF tokens), because a thief watching the loading dock could measure
        the bulge and figure out what&apos;s inside. That&apos;s the BREACH
        attack, and that&apos;s why the middleware skips compression on
        sensitive headers and small responses by default.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Daloy ships a focused compression slice: a first-party{" "}
        <code>compression()</code> middleware that uses the web-standard{" "}
        <code>CompressionStream</code> API instead of a Node-only compression
        package.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock
        code={`import { App, compression } from "@daloyjs/core";

const app = new App({ env: "production" });

app.use(compression());
`}
        language="ts"
      />

      <h2>What it compresses</h2>
      <p>
        The middleware negotiates <code>br</code>, <code>gzip</code>, and{" "}
        <code>deflate</code> from the request <code>Accept-Encoding</code>
        header and the runtime codecs available through{" "}
        <code>CompressionStream</code>. Runtime support is probed once and
        cached. If the platform has no supported codec, the middleware becomes a
        silent no-op instead of breaking older runtimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default <code>minimumSize</code> is <code>1024</code> bytes. Small
        responses are left alone, and Daloy also checks the compressed byte
        length after encoding. If compression made the payload larger, the
        original response is kept.
      </p>

      <h2>Security skip rules</h2>
      <p>
        Compression can become an oracle when secrets and attacker-controlled
        bytes share the same compressed response. Daloy keeps those guards built
        in rather than asking every app to remember the same list.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Skips responses with <code>Set-Cookie</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skips requests with <code>Authorization</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skips requests carrying session, CSRF, XSRF, <code>__Host-</code>, or{" "}
          <code>__Secure-</code> cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skips any response that already has <code>Content-Encoding</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skips non-<code>GET</code> / non-<code>HEAD</code> requests and
          non-2xx responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skips already-compressed content types such as images, video, audio,
          archives, fonts, WebAssembly, and PDFs. <code>image/svg+xml</code> is
          carved back in because it is XML text.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cache and ETag behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Every response that reaches <code>compression()</code> gets{" "}
        <code>Vary: Accept-Encoding</code> appended (de-duplicated against any
        existing <code>Vary</code> value), even when Daloy decides not to
        compress that specific response. That keeps downstream caches keyed by
        the negotiation surface from the first response onward, so a cache
        can&apos;t serve a gzipped body to a client that only advertised{" "}
        <code>identity</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a compressed response already has a strong ETag such as{" "}
        <code>&quot;abc&quot;</code>, Daloy downgrades it to{" "}
        <code>W/&quot;abc&quot;</code>. The ETag was computed over the upstream
        body, not the compressed wire bytes, so a weak validator is the honest
        one, RFC 9110 §8.8.1 requires strong validators to be byte-equal to the
        representation on the wire, and the wire bytes change per encoding.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Interaction with <code>etag()</code>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <code>compression()</code> and <code>etag()</code> are safe to combine
        in either order. Both run as <code>onSend</code> hooks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            If <code>etag()</code> runs first
          </strong>{" "}
          it sets a strong ETag over the uncompressed body.{" "}
          <code>compression()</code> then encodes the body and downgrades the
          strong ETag to weak so the validator stays consistent with what
          actually leaves the server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            If <code>compression()</code> runs first
          </strong>{" "}
          it encodes the body. <code>etag()</code> then hashes the
          already-compressed bytes, which is also valid, the strong tag still
          byte-matches the wire bytes the client receives.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Either way, conditional <code>GET</code>s using{" "}
        <code>If-None-Match</code> stay correct across <code>br</code>,{" "}
        <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code>, and <code>identity</code>{" "}
        clients because the <code>Vary: Accept-Encoding</code> header forces
        per-encoding cache keys. You don&apos;t have to manage the weak/strong
        downgrade yourself, even if you set <code>ETag</code> manually from a
        route handler, <code>compression()</code> performs the downgrade for you
        on the way out.
      </p>

      <h2>No compression level knob</h2>
      <p>
        <code>CompressionStream</code> uses the runtime default. Daloy refuses
        any <code>compressLevel</code> option at construction, including{" "}
        <code>6</code>, because exposing the knob invites expensive level-9
        compression for tiny byte savings under load.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock
        code={`app.use(compression({
  minimumSize: 2 * 1024,
  encodings: ["gzip"],
  authCookieNames: ["tenant-auth"],
  excludeContentTypes: ["application/x-parquet"],
}));`}
        language="ts"
      />

      <h2>Ordering</h2>
      <p>
        Register <code>compression()</code> after middleware that may add{" "}
        <code>Set-Cookie</code>, <code>Content-Encoding</code>, or{" "}
        <code>ETag</code> headers. Daloy runs <code>onSend</code> hooks in
        registration order, so the compression hook should see the final
        response headers before it decides whether to encode the body.
      </p>
