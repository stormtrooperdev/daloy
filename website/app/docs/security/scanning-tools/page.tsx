      <h1>Recommended scanning tools</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Think of it like…</strong> airport security. There are always-on
        metal detectors at the door (Socket Firewall, in-line on every install),
        randomly-scheduled bag checks (Snyk / Aikido scans on every PR), and a
        watch-list desk that knows which travellers are wanted elsewhere
        (vulnerability databases). You want all three — each one catches things
        the others miss.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Yes: we recommend pairing DaloyJS with external security scanning. The
        framework gives you strong defaults in the source tree &mdash; blocked
        lifecycle scripts, source-verified lockfiles, a 24h release-age
        cooldown, strict schema conventions, <code>fetchGuard</code> SSRF
        controls, JWT algorithm allowlists, timing-safe comparisons, and many{" "}
        <code>verify:*</code> CI gates. See{" "}
        <a href="/docs/security/supply-chain">Supply-chain security</a> for the
        full posture.
      </p>
      <p>
        External scanners cover the moving parts DaloyJS cannot know from inside
        your repository: newly disclosed CVEs, live registry threat intel,
        dependency behavior changes, container image risk, cloud and IaC drift,
        and DAST checks against a running API. The right mental model is
        defense-in-depth: DaloyJS keeps dangerous defaults out of the app;
        Socket, Snyk, and Aikido keep watching the world around the app.

        for install-time blocking.
      </p>

      <h3>Why use it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Socket watches package behavior, not only known CVEs. Its alert types
          include install scripts, telemetry, native code, known malware,
          typosquats, git/http dependencies, obfuscated code, shell access,
          network access, environment-variable access, and filesystem access.
        </li>
        <li>
          That maps directly to DaloyJS&apos;s own guardrails:{" "}
          <code>verify:known-dep-names</code>,{" "}
          <code>verify:no-lifecycle-scripts</code>,{" "}
          <code>verify:no-registry-exfiltration</code>, hardened lockfile
          checks, and the 24h release-age cooldown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Socket Firewall Free currently supports JavaScript/TypeScript package
          managers including <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code>, and{" "}
          <code>pnpm</code>. It sits in front of installs and blocks confirmed
          malware before the package reaches your filesystem.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When to use it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use Socket for every DaloyJS project that accepts dependency PRs from
          Dependabot, Renovate, humans, or agents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use Socket Firewall before local or CI installs that add or refresh
          dependencies, especially <code>pnpm add</code>,{" "}
          <code>pnpm install</code>, and template validation jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the Socket CLI when you are not on GitHub, when you want a
          policy-gating command in CI, or when you need scan reports for a
          dashboard.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>Why use it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Snyk is strong when you need CVE evidence, vulnerability remediation
          guidance, automated fix PRs, and reports that security reviewers
          already know how to read.
        </li>
        <li>
          It catches a different class of issue than Socket: not just suspicious
          package behavior, but known vulnerable versions, first-party code
          findings, container base-image issues, Terraform/Kubernetes mistakes,
          and API/web findings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its GitHub integration can run PR checks, regularly monitor imported
          projects, and open signed fix or upgrade pull requests when fixes are
          available.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When to use it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use Snyk when customers, auditors, or procurement ask for an SCA/SAST
          program with recognizable reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use it for projects that ship containers, Kubernetes manifests,
          Terraform, or other infrastructure code alongside the DaloyJS API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the CLI before releases when you want a local or CI gate with
          explicit exit codes. The current <code>snyk test</code> command exits
          non-zero when vulnerabilities are found, and <code>snyk monitor</code>
          creates a monitored dependency snapshot.

      <h3>Why use it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Aikido is useful when you want broad coverage without stitching
          together many vendors. A single repo can have dependency, SAST, IaC,
          secrets, malware, license, code quality, container, DAST/API, and
          cloud findings in one workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its PR gating scans branch diffs and can fail only on new findings at
          or above your configured severity threshold. That makes rollout easier
          on older apps with existing backlog.
        </li>
        <li>
          DaloyJS emits OpenAPI by design, which pairs naturally with
          Aikido&apos;s API scanning and surface monitoring when you deploy a
          staging or production endpoint.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When to use it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use Aikido when a small or mid-size team wants one security inbox and
          one triage workflow instead of separate SCA, SAST, DAST, IaC,
          container, and secrets tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use it when you want branch-level PR gating first, then release gating
          once the signal is tuned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use DAST/API scanning after the DaloyJS app has a stable staging URL
          and a generated OpenAPI document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider Zen Firewall only when you want an additional runtime
          WAF-like layer. It does not replace DaloyJS&apos;s built-in runtime
          guardrails.
        </li>

      <h2>Recommended rollout</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Keep the DaloyJS defaults first: <code>ignore-scripts=true</code>,
          release-age cooldown, source-verified lockfiles, and the
          project&apos;s <code>verify:*</code> gates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Install Socket for GitHub and Socket Firewall for all developers who
          change dependencies. This gives immediate supply-chain feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add either Snyk or Aikido for broader SAST/SCA/IaC/container/API
          coverage. Teams with audit pressure usually start with Snyk; teams
          optimizing for one dashboard often start with Aikido.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run scanners in observe-only mode for a short window. Fix obvious
          criticals, document accepted risk, then require status checks on new
          findings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make ownership explicit. Every ignored finding should have a reason,
          an expiry, and a person or team responsible for revisiting it.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What no scanner replaces</h2>
      <p>
        Do not turn off framework controls after adding a scanner. The scanner
        tells you what it can see; the framework still needs to refuse dangerous
        behavior by default.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep <code>ignore-scripts=true</code>. Even excellent scanners can
          miss day-zero payloads before a signal exists.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the 24h release-age cooldown. It gives the registry, vendors, and
          maintainers time to detect and yank bad versions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep <code>fetchGuard</code>, schema <code>.strict()</code>, JWT
          algorithm allowlists, timing-safe secret comparisons, secure headers,
          rate limits, body limits, and request timeouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep reviewing lockfile diffs. A scanner comment is a signal; it is
          not a substitute for ownership of what ships.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Freshness policy</h2>
      <p>
        To keep this page current, review the linked vendor docs when changing
        recommendations and before major DaloyJS releases. Avoid hardcoding plan
        limits or seat counts; link to the vendors&apos; pricing pages instead:{" "}

      <h2>Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        DaloyJS has no commercial relationship with Socket, Snyk, or Aikido.
        These recommendations are based on how their current public products map
        to DaloyJS&apos;s threat model: secure-by-default framework controls
        plus external visibility into dependencies, code, containers, cloud, and
        live APIs.
