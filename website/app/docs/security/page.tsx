      <h1>Security</h1>
      <p>
        Bad defaults are bugs. DaloyJS separates core-enforced guardrails from
        first-party security middleware so the dangerous things are blocked by
        default and the deployment-specific things stay explicit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Think of it like…</strong> a modern car. Seatbelts, airbags,
        crumple zones, and ABS are built in and armed by default (core
        guardrails). The route the driver takes, who&apos;s allowed in the
        passenger seat, and whether you need a child seat are decisions you make
        per trip (first-party middleware). You don&apos;t have to wire the
        airbag yourself — but you do have to pick a destination.

      <h2>
        <code>csrf()</code> for state-changing routes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Use{" "}
        <a href="/docs/security/csrf">
          <code>csrf()</code>
        </a>{" "}
        to protect mutating endpoints. Two strategies are supported:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Double-submit cookie</strong> (default) &mdash; sets a token
          cookie on safe requests, requires the same value on the{" "}
          <code>x-csrf-token</code> header for unsafe methods, and rejects
          mismatches with a timing-safe <strong>403</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fetch Metadata</strong> (
          <code>strategy: &quot;fetch-metadata&quot;</code>) - tokenless
          protection that relies on the modern <code>Sec-Fetch-Site</code>{" "}
          header. No cookie round-trip; no HTML rendering coupling. Recommended
          for new browser-facing apps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`import { csrf } from "@daloyjs/core";

// Tokenless Fetch-Metadata protection (recommended for browser-facing apps).
app.use(csrf({

  allowedOrigins: ["https://app.example.com"],
}));`}
      />

      <h2>
        <code>secureHeaders()</code> defaults
      </h2>
      <CodeBlock
        language="text"
        code={`content-security-policy: default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'

      />

      <p>
        If you need a different CSP, want to disable HSTS in local development,
        or need a looser permissions policy, pass options to{" "}
        <code>secureHeaders()</code> explicitly. The legacy{" "}
        <code>X-XSS-Protection: 0</code> header is opt-in via{" "}
        <code>xssProtection: true</code> for deployments that want to explicitly
        disable old browser XSS filters.
      </p>

      <h3>CSP with per-request nonces &amp; Trusted Types</h3>
      <p>
        <code>secureHeaders()</code> can build the CSP from a directive map and
        inject a fresh <strong>per-request nonce</strong> into{" "}
        <code>script-src</code>, <code>script-src-elem</code>,{" "}
        <code>style-src</code>, and <code>style-src-elem</code>, plus emit{" "}
        <code>require-trusted-types-for &apos;script&apos;</code> for runtime
        DOM XSS hardening. The nonce is exposed at{" "}
        <code>ctx.state.cspNonce</code> so handlers can render it into{" "}
        <code>&lt;script nonce=&quot;...&quot;&gt;</code> tags.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`import { secureHeaders } from "@daloyjs/core";

      <h2>SQL injection</h2>
      <p>
        Daloy doesn&apos;t ship a database driver, but the HTTP boundary it{" "}
        <em>does</em> own (strict Zod schemas, hardened JSON parser, body-size
        caps) shrinks the surface that reaches your repository layer. See{" "}
        <a href="/docs/security/sql-injection">SQL injection</a> for the safe
        vs. unsafe patterns per ORM (Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely, raw drivers), an
        allowlisting recipe for dynamic <code>ORDER BY</code>, and the grep
        rules the maintainers use to catch regressions.
      </p>

      <h2>Command injection</h2>
      <p>
        DaloyJS&apos;s runtime is <code>child_process</code>-free by CI gate, so
        the framework itself cannot shell out. See{" "}
        <a href="/docs/security/command-injection">Command injection</a> for the
        safe shape of a handler that does need to invoke an external program (
        <code>execFile</code> + argv array, never{" "}
        <code>exec(`cmd ${"${input}"}`)</code>), the Windows <em>BatBadBut</em>{" "}
        footgun, and the grep rules to keep new bugs out at PR time.
      </p>

      <h2>Admin panels</h2>
      <p>
        Building an admin or customer-success surface on top of DaloyJS? See{" "}
        <a href="/docs/security/admin-panels">Secure admin panels</a> for the
        recommended pattern: <code>internal: true</code> routes,{" "}
        <code>ipRestriction()</code>, strict CSP with per-request nonces,
        per-admin authentication, login-throttle <code>rateLimit()</code>
        groups, and structured audit logging &mdash; mapped one-to-one to
        Aikido&apos;s public &quot;secure admin panel&quot; checklist.
      </p>

      <h2>Supply-chain</h2>
      <p>
        DaloyJS is distributed via{" "}
        <a href="https://pnpm.io/motivation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          pnpm
        </a>{" "}
        for a stricter install model. Scaffolded pnpm apps inherit the
        install-time controls, while DaloyJS&apos;s own repository and the
        optional GitHub Actions bundle add CI/CD controls against the
        cache-poisoning, maintainer-phishing, and OIDC token-abuse patterns seen
        in recent npm incidents.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strict isolation</strong> — packages cannot reach phantom
          dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content-addressable store</strong> — every byte is hashed and
          verified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frozen lockfile in CI</strong> with{" "}
          <code>--ignore-scripts</code> — reproducible installs without
          transitive lifecycle execution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <code>verify-store-integrity</code>
          </strong>{" "}
          — corruption-detecting reads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <code>strict-peer-dependencies</code>
          </strong>{" "}
          — no silent peer mismatches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <code>minimum-release-age=1440</code>
          </strong>{" "}
          — wait 24h before installing fresh releases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <code>ignore-scripts=true</code>
          </strong>{" "}
          with explicit <code>pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies</code> — reviewed
          allowlist for native install scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SHA-pinned GitHub Actions</strong> — the optional generated
          GitHub workflows pin third-party actions to immutable commits, not
          mutable tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protected DaloyJS npm publishing</strong> — the
          framework&apos;s own packages use a tag-only release workflow,
          protected environment approval, OIDC trusted publishing, and{" "}
          <code>--provenance</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your generated app lives outside GitHub, carry over the portable
        parts directly and translate the GitHub workflow rules to your CI host.
        The framework cannot enforce branch protection or runner egress in a
        private GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or on-prem installation.
      </p>

      <h2>Trusted proxies and rate limiting</h2>
      <p>
        DaloyJS no longer trusts <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> or{" "}
        <code>X-Real-IP</code> by default when deriving a rate-limit key. Those
        headers are client-spoofable unless your reverse proxy strips and
        rewrites them. The default limiter is therefore global until you provide
        an explicit <code>keyGenerator</code> or opt in to{" "}
        <code>trustProxyHeaders: true</code> behind a trusted proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For credential-entry routes, use{" "}
        <a href="/docs/security/websocket-login-throttle">
          <code>loginThrottle()</code>
        </a>{" "}
        across <code>/login</code>, OTP, and password-reset routes, and{" "}
        <code>wsRateLimit()</code> on related WebSocket upgrades. Both helpers
        can spend from the same <code>groupId</code> bucket.
      </p>

      <h2>Self-hosted docs assets</h2>
      <p>
        The built-in docs helpers no longer force a jsDelivr-shaped CSP. You can
        self-host the Swagger UI or Scalar assets, add a nonce to the bootstrap
        script, and emit a same-origin CSP for your docs route.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`import {
  swaggerUiHtml,
