      <h1>Inbound request-decompression bomb guard</h1>
      <p>
        DaloyJS core deliberately does <strong>not</strong> decompress request
        bodies — it is <em>safe by omission</em>. A{" "}
        <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> request body is read as-is, and a
        schema parse simply fails on the compressed bytes. The moment you inflate
        attacker-supplied bytes, though, you inherit the classic{" "}
        <strong>decompression bomb</strong> (a.k.a. &quot;zip bomb&quot;): a few
        kilobytes of crafted gzip can expand to gigabytes and blow straight past{" "}
        <code>bodyLimitBytes</code>, which only ever sees the small compressed
        payload.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of <strong>0.37.0</strong> DaloyJS ships{" "}
        <code>requestDecompression()</code> — the opt-in middleware that adds
        request decompression <strong>with the bomb guard baked in</strong>. It
        inflates the body with two independent caps enforced <em>during</em>{" "}
        inflation, so a bomb is aborted long before it is fully materialised in
        memory.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick start</h2>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`import { App, requestDecompression } from "@daloyjs/core";

const app = new App();

// Register globally so it runs before schema-body validation.
app.use(requestDecompression({
  maxDecompressedBytes: 1024 * 1024, // inflated body never exceeds 1 MiB
  maxCompressedBytes: 64 * 1024,     // reject compressed uploads over 64 KiB
  maxRatio: 50,                      // and never expand more than 50x
}));`}
      />
      <p>
        The middleware runs in the <code>onRequest</code> phase — before the
        per-request context (and therefore before schema-body validation) is
        built — and stashes the inflated bytes on the request so the
        framework&apos;s own body reader transparently sees the decompressed
        payload. That means it works for both schema-validated bodies{" "}
        <em>and</em> handlers that read the raw body themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>The two caps</h2>
      <p>
        A single absolute byte cap is not enough on its own: a small payload can
        stay under it yet still amplify wildly. <code>requestDecompression()</code>{" "}
        enforces both, during inflation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>maxDecompressedBytes</code> (<strong>required</strong>) — the
          inflated body may never exceed this many bytes. Inflation aborts the
          moment output crosses this value. There is no &quot;unlimited&quot;
          mode. Set this at or below your <code>bodyLimitBytes</code> so the
          inflated payload still fits the body the rest of the app expects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>maxRatio</code> (default <code>100</code>) — the inflated size
          may never exceed <code>compressedBytes * maxRatio</code>, catching
          small-but-explosive payloads that would stay under the absolute cap in
          isolation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Crossing either cap aborts inflation and rejects the request with{" "}
        <code>413 Payload Too Large</code> (a{" "}
        <code>DecompressionBombError</code>) — the reader is cancelled mid-stream,
        so the full bomb is never materialised.
      </p>

      <h2>Bounding the compressed input</h2>
      <p>
        <code>maxCompressedBytes</code> (default <code>1048576</code> / 1 MiB)
        caps the <em>compressed</em> upload before a single byte is inflated. An
        oversized compressed body is rejected with <code>413</code> without
        inflating anything.
      </p>

      <h2>Supported encodings</h2>
      <p>
        Built on the web-standard <code>DecompressionStream</code>, so the same
        line works on Node, Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, and Vercel Edge. Only{" "}
        <code>gzip</code> and <code>deflate</code> are accepted (the encodings{" "}
        <code>DecompressionStream</code> implements consistently across runtimes).
        <strong> Brotli is intentionally excluded</strong> — it is not part of the
        Compression Streams spec and is unavailable on most runtimes. Restrict the
        allowlist with <code>encodings</code>:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`app.use(requestDecompression({
  maxDecompressedBytes: 512 * 1024,
  encodings: ["gzip"], // accept gzip only; deflate uploads get a 415
}));`}
      />

      <h2>Error responses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>413</code> — a decompression bomb tripped either cap, or the
          compressed upload exceeded <code>maxCompressedBytes</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>415</code> — an unknown, non-allowlisted, runtime-unsupported, or{" "}
          <strong>layered</strong> (<code>gzip, gzip</code>) encoding. Layered
          encodings are a classic nested-bomb vector and are refused rather than
          inflated recursively. The response carries an{" "}
          <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header listing the allowed encodings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>400</code> — a malformed / truncated compressed stream. Refusing
          (rather than treating a malformed body as empty) prevents
          request-smuggling-style desync with any downstream parser.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Requests without a <code>Content-Encoding</code> (or with{" "}
        <code>identity</code>) pass through untouched, and{" "}
        <code>GET</code> / <code>HEAD</code> requests are never decompressed — so
        bodyless and uncompressed traffic pays nothing.
      </p>

      <h2>Observability</h2>
      <p>
        Pass <code>onBomb</code> to record rejected bombs (it fires before the{" "}
        <code>413</code> is thrown). It receives the structured{" "}
        <code>DecompressionBombInfo</code> — the encoding, compressed size,
        inflated bytes produced before the abort, and which cap tripped (
        <code>&quot;absolute&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;ratio&quot;</code>):
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        language="ts"
        code={`app.use(requestDecompression({
  maxDecompressedBytes: 1024 * 1024,
  onBomb: (info) => {
    metrics.increment("request.decompression.bomb", {
      encoding: info.encoding,
      reason: info.reason,
    });
  },
}));`}
      />

      <h2>Low-level helper</h2>
      <p>
        <code>decompressRequestBody(compressed, encoding, opts)</code> is exported
        for custom flows that read raw bytes themselves — it inflates with the
        exact same bomb-resistant semantics and the same caps.
      </p>

      <h2>Relationship to <code>bodyLimitBytes</code></h2>
      <p>
        <code>bodyLimitBytes</code> caps the body the app reads — which, with this
        guard installed, is the <em>inflated</em> payload. Keep{" "}
        <code>maxDecompressedBytes</code> at or below <code>bodyLimitBytes</code>{" "}
        so a request that survives the bomb guard still fits the limit the rest of
        the stack assumes. Without this middleware, <code>bodyLimitBytes</code>{" "}
        only ever sees the compressed bytes — which is exactly why an unguarded
        decompression step is dangerous.
      </p>
    </>
